Liberal,2018-11-06,Changing party affiliation in response to Kavenough,13,9m2dtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/9m2dtt/changing_party_affiliation_in_response_to/,49,1538913797.0,"Hey everyone,

So, I've long tried to be the moderate conservative that you all occasionally pretend still exists in this country. I only ever broke party lines during the last presidential election. I never voted for Barack Obama, though I found him to be an alright president as time went on. I even worked for a Republican senatorial campaign.

I also worked in EMS, and saw several victims of sexual assault in my time working there. I objected strongly to Brett Kavenough, to the point where I have just been permanently banned from r/Conservative over using the phrase, ""God help you"" in response to his supporters. It is for emotional reasons, I will admit. I believe Dr. Ford off the basis of her testimony, and my own personal experiences with Kavenough's alma mater. But, more importantly, I also cannot deny that this is a man who does not belong enforcing fair and impartial law.

I've never been a Democrat. I'll be perfectly honest, I still don't like most of the policies you all seek to enact, barring healthcare. But I can't stand by and watch while the division of government is torn apart. Scalia would not have abided by it. I know many of you dislike him, but if there is one thing he made explicitly clear regarding his judicial philosophy, it was a profound belief in the necessity of avoiding the consolidation of power into a single party in the three branches of government.

I'm voting Democrat for the second time ever next election. And if I am, I'm sure some others of us are doing it too. One day, I hope to see a government that represents me, but that seems far off.

We aren't all bad, all of us. In the words of Obama, there's hope.

Please be gentle with those who are still on the fence. That's how you convince them you are correct, not through anger.

I speak from experience."

You see, I'm usually the guy who brings up that in economics, raising minimum wage causes higher unemployment. If employment is FORCED to keep up somehow (social programs and incentives), then you end up with high taxes and either lowered standards of living or raised costs of living. All in all, there has always been a net negative in my eyes, but I'm mostly a liberal when it comes to most things in general. I've always wanted to believe in higher wages, but I still think 15/hr may come at a bad price.

  
I'd like a very thorough explanation as to why minimum wage being higher is good for American economics, specifically emitting empathy as a reason. I believe in empathy in most cases but the net positive means that it fires back, in my mind."

American conservatism seems to be taking over, for some reason it appears that the right wins everything. From Merrick Garland, to Trump and even Kavanaugh- I just don't see America heading in the right direction it feels like we are heading to our fall. The collapse of the worlds most powerful empire. Hopefully NOVEMBER 6th will bring many changes upon us but there's a chance it could all go the wrong way.

I went to Europe for a month (Sweden) and I have to say it was quite amazing. The people, the culture.. It's a literal liberal paradise. Im started to despise this country; our obsession with celebrities, the work life, the pure ignorance of our people and of course all the fucking shootings..... I want to live in a country where people have a similar mindset to mine. I want simplicity, I want out of America's self obsessed culture. 

I've been looking into New Zealand and Canada. Would chose Sweden but lol they don't want Americans. Any liberals relate to this?"

In this day and age, it seems that everybody would rather leave a single hateful comment on a post, yell at each other, or just completely lose it at the mention of anything political. I want to be open minded and civil about the issue, so if there is an issue or question that you want to ask a right-winged individual without any droning and meaningless debate, ask away. 

Other things about me:

- Australian, but lived in the USA at the time of the 2016 elections
- I originally wanted Hillary Clinton to win, but over time I became more right wing 
- it’s pretty late, so if I don’t reply immediately, I’ll reply in a few hours

In principle I’m generally against getting something for nothing but the idea of people being guaranteed their basic needs is something I can be on board with. My question is how would you do it and what should it cover?

So I feel like housing, food, and water are all easily yes, the argument comes when you get into healthcare and communication and things similar to that where one could argue it is necessary although by strict interpretation it’s not. I’m under the impression that if America were to do UBI it’d replace all other social programs so no more social security no more Medicaid or Medicare and no more welfare or food stamps. I guess the core questions I have are,:

Would it be money that could only be spent on such items (whichever we agree is necessary) in the same way as food stamps? Or would it be more you get a check every week and spend it however you see fit? 

Would there be an opt out or transfer option? Like if someone who’s sole or primary source of income was UBI decides they’d rather live in a better house or better neighborhood than have healthcare would they be allowed to do that?

And should it vary depending on where you live, and if so how micro should we go? Someone living in California has a higher living cost than someone in say Texas, however I’m sure there are counties in Texas that have a higher cost than some counties in California. Should this be a factor and how small should we go, state, region, or all the way down to county?

Thanks for any replies hoping we get a good discussion going!"

Firstly I’m sort of in the middle. I’m 18 I haven’t had enough experiences yet to form an opinion. But what gets me is that they said they wanted to have a “talk” with me before the mid terms. I’ll be damned before I vote for people who are going to support Trump. They don’t support the Hondurans marching towards the border for asylum. They say the “asylum” issue is just an excuse to get in illegally. I’ve informed them that Honduras has a corrupt government and then they said that they shouldn’t come in by the thousands. However they still think it’s an excuse. Before I just start going into a deeper rant what do you guys suggest I do to hold them off until the election and maybe even shift the way they view it

P.S. they’re conservative Christians you’d think they’d be all for accepting people who are going through hardship.

If you want a society with fewer abortions, your only choice is to vote for Democrats. That is the only party with a platform that will actually reduce the number of abortions - access to birth control, comprehensive sex education, expanding access to health care like Planned Parenthood (most importantly prenatal care), even affordable education and early childcare/welfare/food stamps to provide economic assistance after birth make a huge impact on the frequency of abortions. Not coincidentally, these are the planks of the Democratic platform.

The Republican answer is to simply ban the medical practice, which doesn’t prevent abortions but makes them less safe for the mothers. Outlawing abortions also fails to acknowledge the instances in which abortions are a medical necessity or the least bad of two choices. It’s not a good choice, but is one that many hopeful mothers are forced to make - when the genetic or ultrasound tests show that the fetus will not survive the pregnancy or the birth. It is a terrible decision but one that a mother/father must make with the physician. Sometimes that heartbreaking choice is not available until after 20 weeks. The Republicans insert themselves between a women and her OB/GYN with unnecessary testing and sometimes force the physician to lie.

I understand that some people see this as a black and white issue, but as with most things in life, the practice is quite gray. There are legitimate, medical reasons for abortions or induced miscarriages, and they are all sad and terrible. If if there wasn’t a medical reason, this should be a decision a woman gets to make for her own self, her own body. The answer isn’t to make the women criminals or punish the physicians. The answer is to make the practice an unnecessary as possible and that is where Democratic policies win the argument hands down."

Lots of them family and acquaintances. The #1 most annoying thing I hear is “I love Trump”. This boils my blood and I want to run off into an endless political debate  in which their “watabout’ism” is effective in diluting the conversation. So I’m not at a loss for a laundry list of things Trump and his administration have done to destroy this county... but these conversations aren’t productive and I’ll never change their mind.

So.... I’m  looking for a quick list of short respectful questions to ask that draws out the hypocrisy and tribalism in the Republican Party while effectively boxing them in and shutting them down. The last question should leave them with no answer. No conversation, just a lingering air of their mean-ness and lack of logic...

TLDR: Need quick short questions to box in Trump supporters."

Their arguments were that Christians are just as oppressed if not MORE. They said because of what the kkk did and other things, most everyone hates Christians. I was dumbfounded. How the fuck can you compare Christians to muslims in terms of oppression. Sure everyone frowned upon the KKK and what they stood for but by no means are they on the same level as muslims. When a Christian sits next to you on a plane do you hope your breath for a second or two? When a bombing happens does everyone automatically point fingers at the Christians? When you see them in public, do they feel every eye on them? Of course not. I am neither liberal or conservative. I see the light in both sides. However it baffles me how fucking stupid hardcore Trump supporters are. Change my mind."

I don't like the Republican party OR the Democratic party. Being in the center of this political and social hurricane has been an alarming nightmare. One of the Things that has really stood out to me is how much harder it is to get informed about whats going on. News sources from both sides are horrendous. To me Daily wire is the red version of Huffington Post. Fox News is the same thing as CNN but cherry flavor instead of blue raspberry.

Daily wire review: https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/ Huffington post review: https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/

So, what I would like to discuss is. How do you rate your news sources. How do you determine what outlet still has journalistic integrity? What sources do you use that counter your opinion to start comparing and contrasting to avoid just getting caught in the ""mind trap"" of letting someone else thing for you? I really genuinely want to know about this.

Liberal,2018-11-06,Just a reminder that the U.S. could save over half a Trillion dollars PER YEAR by implementing 3 common sense legislation pieces the rest of the world already has,469,9tpooc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/9tpooc/just_a_reminder_that_the_us_could_save_over_half/,72,1541233292.0," Going by the conservative estimates (from a Koch brothers funded study, that is), transferring to a single payer health care system would save on average [$200 Billion per year](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf). Medicare for all is something virtually every other developed nation has and has better outcomes than the U.S..

Furthermore, tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy with teams of lawyers result in the loss of around [$70 Billion per year](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html). Of course there will always be loopholes and even the most comprehensive legislation couldn't solve all of tax avoidance. So let's call it $50 Billion.

The final part of this trifecta is the fact the U.S. spends more on it's defense budget ($610 Billion) than the next 7 largest militaries in the world [combined](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/05/02/us-remains-top-military-spender-sipri-reports/). If you were to cut our defense spending in half, that would free up over $300 Billion AND we'd still be spending $77 Billion more than the second largest military budget, that being China's. Also it's important to note that most of the worlds largest militaries are our allies so that's an even further incentive to reallocate our tax dollars to something other than the military.

Add up all those saving and you wind up with a cool $555 Billion, PER YEAR.

That amount of money is enough to fund a Trillion dollar infrastructure bill to rebuild America over 10 years, which also includes a comprehensive 5G network all over the states ($100 Billion). That's enough to create tuition free college in the U.S. ([$75 Billion](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487794394/hillary-s-free-tuition-promise-what-would-it-cost-how-would-it-work)), something else the rest of the developed world has. That's enough to fully restore NASA's budget to 1% of the federal budget (an additional [$30 Billion](https://www.thebalance.com/nasa-budget-current-funding-and-history-3306321)). That's enough to dive head first into complying with the Paris Climate Agreement and to combat climate change ([$150 Billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/02/fact-checking-trump-speech-paris-climate-agreement/102399674/) at the very high end even according to Trump...).

You add up all those ""pie in the sky"", ""ultra radical"" amounts and you still wind up with $200 Billion PER YEAR left over to spend. That could go very nicely into a tax cut to the middle and poor class, or fixing the Flint Michigan water crisis. Just for example.

Go vote this Tuesday everybody."

**3 Registration Methods:**

* **Register online:** This is available for 31 states plus DC. [List here.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx#Table%20of%20states%20w/ovr)
* **Mail-in:** If your state does not yet offer online registration, use the national mail in form [here](http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/Federal%20Voter%20Registration_1209_en8242012.pdf):

* **In-Person:** You can also register in person with your [state or local election office](https://www.usa.gov/election-office). 

**NOTE**: [15 states](http://www.mytimetovote.com/election-day-registration.html) let you register in person on Election Day, but that's not recommended because of extended wait times, unpredictable eligibility requirements, and voter suppression tactics.

She tells me that she heard on the news there was a larger turn out of Hispanic votes for this midterm election than there was the presidential election. I said, “So? That’s great! I heard the college vote is way up, too!” She replies, “Well, obviously they’re just a bunch of illegals voting.” Now, obviously if there’s reports of a larger Hispanic vote, these would be verified votes, not to mention that you’re required to provide photo I.D. when voting in Texas.

This is also my first time posting here so not sure if this is better suited elsewhere. (I was initially thinking about heading to r/rant)

Anyway, it just hit me today...I need to start strictly patronizing any and everything that celebrates America. 

We need to make sure we do not spend our money with people and places that will ultimately back a president who demonizes immigrants and anyone who is different. I will make an effort not to give my money, time. and reviews to corporations and (small or large) business that elect officials who perpetuate hate, show distaste for diversity, spew anti American rhetoric. 

I will double check every service I uses (I'm talking, where I eat, my dentist/doctors, my music streaming services, household products, my bakery, every single MF thing/person) to make sure I do not support people who will ultimately end up doing more harm to me, my fellow Americans, and this very earth.

Clearly they have no moral dimension and it does not matter how much you try to reason. But I know the money will make a difference. "

Strange times we live in eh? Truth and fact itself are subjective now. I wonder where this leads, and there are markers in history. Disenfranchisement, misinformation, these are not new phenomena. Joseph Goebblers put it best I think:

"" We enter the Reichstag to arm ourselves with democracy’s weapons. If democracy is foolish enough to give us free railway passes and salaries, that is its problem... We are coming neither as friends or neutrals. We come as enemies! As the wolf attacks the sheep, so come we. ""

A master of misinformation ahead of his time created this mess. Now the Republican party uses this weapon against its own people. To dismantle the constitution instead of reinforce it. To strip people of the dignity that democracy has brought most of us. And to hand over our nation's wealth to those that don't need it.

History may not repeat itself but it sure does rhyme."

Conservative,2018-11-06,"""Christine Ford seems like a much more credible person than Brett Kavanaugh"" well...",2,9m2kyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9m2kyz/christine_ford_seems_like_a_much_more_credible/,1,1538915973.0,"That's what a lot of the dems arguments were. They were like ""oh we have strong evidence that Kav got drunk and made crude remarks to his friends.""  Meanwhile Ford is some always honest highly respected angel. So the ""logical conclusion"" is to believe Ford and think that Kav is lying.

Well there's a reason for that. Brett's past was open season. They got all sorts of character assassins saying nonsense like ""I was his roommate at one point and he was an asshole"" or ""I was his drinking buddy and he was pretty irresponsible while he was drunk."" We know a ton about his past now, and we know he wasn't perfect because no one is. And look you will never be able to convince me that ""Renate Alumni"" was a term of endearment. Everyone knows how boys at an all boys catholic school are.

However in Ford's case. Her past is off limits. No one can dare mention the fact that she cheated one at least one of her ex boyfriends. Or draw attention to the fact that she was sneaking out to go to these parties at age 15 without her parents permission. No one is allowed to ask her former roommates if she was known as an honest person. Or if she ever made up stories that weren't true for attention. No one is even allowed to accuse her of lying, they need to diplomatically imply (but not directly say) that she's mistaken. The moment someone says they're a survivor, in this current climate, their past is off limits, especially their past relationships. Their reputation is off limits. In fact you can barely even cross examine them (because it might be triggering!)

So then is it any wonder, that the survivor comes off as a more reputable person than the one they're accusing?

But the immunities they already have aren't enough. Now the far left is holding up signs that say ""we believe all survivors!"" I guess that's the logical next step. We've already established that a survivor is a Good Person (TM) with a character that's beyond reproach. It only follows from that that someone such as Ford is incapable of lying.

I am so glad that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the supreme court. This shows the left that even though the rules of this game have been stacked so heavily in their favor, they still lose!"

I’ve been open to many opposing political/religious beliefs for a long time now, and the Kavanaugh insanity is the first major political scandal I’ve experienced and kept up with.

I’m disgusted. I know people are sick of hearing this on r/Conservative right now, but I’m not sorry for expressing this. I’m disgusted that there are people willing to commit such heinous acts to maintain power, and to commit these heinous acts against another human being. I’m looking at you, Feinstein.

I was never swayed in my views, and now I’m 100x reassured I’m on the (mostly) best side to be on. Thanks to Democrats for being such ignorant, partisan “senators” as to cause a surge of red among my classmates who haven’t yet found a place in politics. Thanks to Republicans for unifying on this matter, and blessings to Kavanaugh as our Justice.

I'm a registered Democrat but this thing red pilled me. It's like waking up from a trance and looking at all the former shows and news I enjoyed and watched and seeing it with a brand new eyes and hearing it for what it really is, a load of bull shit. I can see now how the MSM are full of one sided crap and an echo chamber, in which we were constantly repeating the leftist mantra of tolerance and freedom whilst acting the exact opposite. I used to see a conservative person as a backward gun toting hick with little to no education because that's what is being portrayed in the media and I just accepted it. 

The Dems overplayed this thing, trying to destroy a pretty decent guy for political gain, and the worst thing they could find about this guy is that he drank during high school and he threw an ice cube at a bar, including a barrage of accusations without and substance or evidence. This is what got me and I believe a lot more like me. That they can fuck a man's life, one who has stellar record and a family man, that easily. That guy is a GOOD guy, and look at the damage they've done. What do you think the narrative is going to be if Kavanaugh didn't go through, that they can destroy a good man's life just because it is to their benefit. What does that say to you and me whom I can argue with high confidence that has way way worse record than a supreme Court judge.

All I can say is to forgive those protestors, they don't know what they are doing, they really don't. All the MSM and college campuses are almost entirely spouting liberal agenda. It is run by emotions, not facts, and we were taught that emotions are enough, that if we felt deep inside that we were wronged then that is right, facts be damned. 

I hope I'm not alone on this one, as this emotionally driven idiocy has to stop. I guess this is the time I #walkaway.

Nice to meet you guys, glad to be finally here.

To cut right to it, I am a political psychology researcher, and I try and study the political divide between the left and right, and analyze partisan bias.

Although I am surely what this sub would term a ""fellow conservative"" (since I subscribe to this sub while being left-leaning), I am principled in my belief that exposure to a healthy balance of views regarding social, economic, and political matters is the best way to stave off partisan prejudice becoming an all-consuming force in one's life.

The point of my post today is simply gaining perspective from the conservatives who congregate here in this sub. I have questions that I would love to hear opinions on, and will try and answer posts as they come in, as appropriate. Mods, feel free to let me know if I have broken any rules with this post, last thing I want to do is clutter the feed. I hope this post is seen as the good-faith posting it is, and not as some attempt at ""trolling"".

Thank you for taking the time to read this far, and I hope you all have a good day/evening.

Questions:

1. What are topics that you believe individuals on the left actively do not understand, or struggle to understand? That is to say, topics that those on the left do not interpret positions on the right correctly, not just the Left disagreeing with the right. For those topics, what is the misunderstanding and how do you justify your position?

2. For any #WalkAway subscribers, how do you evaluate political candidates? Do you focus solely on Republican candidates and find your best fit on the right? Do you vote based upon the positions on specific policies, or do you vote holistically (that is, you evaluate the candidate overall)?

3. There is a large discrepancy between liberal and conservative interpretations of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his demeanor. As conservatives, what behaviors would a judicial nominee display that would make you wary of pledging support for him/her?"

In 1898, Dewey outlined what had to be done to transform the public  schools into a vehicle for the promotion of socialism. A pro-socialist  education establishment was created. They held their confidential  meetings at an annual event called the Cleveland Conference, organized  in 1915 by Prof. Charles Judd, head of the University of Chicago School  of Education. Judd, who got his Ph.D. at Leipzig under Prof. Wilhelm  Wundt, was leading the movement to organize education reform in  conformity with psycho-progressive-socialist goals.

**“It isn't a coincidence that governments everywhere want to  educate children. Government education, in turn, is supposed to be  evidence of the state's goodness and its concern for our well-being. The  real explanation is less flattering. If the government's propaganda can  take root as children grow up, those kids will be no threat to the  state apparatus. They'll fasten the chains to their own ankles.”**

Conservative,2018-11-06,What's Known about Christine Blasey Ford,18,9m7inc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9m7inc/whats_known_about_christine_blasey_ford/,5,1538966433.0,"I've been watching many videos for the past several days about kav, ford, and swetnick and also read some web page articles about them. Here are some things that I've learned about ford:

* her high school was full of drunken, promiscuous sluts who liked to drink until blacking out. This is from her high school yearbook pages. Look them up. These pages were scrubbed from the internet recently to protect Ford from looking bad, but someone re-uploaded them.
* Ford's entire social media presence & records have been scrubbed/erased from the internet. I assume she didn't want us to know what kind of person she really is.
* Ford was one of the high school sluts and her nickname was ""ballsey,"" a play on her middle name.
* Ford lied & perjured herself when she said she had a 2nd door because she was claustrophobic because of the sex attack. The 2nd door was there for business reasons. Part of her house was used for business & rental. Her ex boyfriend said she's not claustrophobic at all.
* Ford lied & perjured herself when she said that she never gave anyone tips on taking a polygraph test. Her ex boyfriend said she coached her friend on polygraph tests to help her get a government job.
* Ford lied when she said she didn't want to fly to Washington because she's scared of flying. She actually has flown many times for vacations and work reasons.
* She had never mentioned Kavanaugh by name to her therapist and she refuses to release her therapist notes. She also originally said that 4 men had sexually attacked her, then she changed the story to 2 men.
* She claims to have forgotten every major and basic piece of info about the sexual attack's location, time, how she got home, who took her home, who drove her to the party, and so on, but there's many other women who've been sexually attacked who say that they remember everything about it and the circumstances and even how things smelled. Ford claims she can't remember any info that could possibly be investigated for the sake of corroboration of her accusation, except for some names of the people at the party, and all those people deny having been at the party or say they can't remember such a party.
* Ford's ex boyfriend said that after he found out she cheated on him, she used his credit card and spent a lot of money with it. She refused to pay him back until he threatened to press charges.
* The prosecutor who questioned her at the senate judiciary meeting wrote a report that said that Ford's case is very weak, even weaker than a normal ""he said she said"" case, and that this case would be too weak to go to a trial. And she said there were many inconsistencies in Ford's testimony.
* Ford made many donations to a leftist political organization
* Ford marched in the washington women's march, which was an anti-trump march, where women wore pink pussy hats made of knitted yarn.
* Ford had made multiple pink pussy hats, except her version was made to look like a brain. (ha! she looks like an idiot to me)
* Ford has been teaching a class for CIA students. In addition her grandfather was in the CIA or something like that. So it looks like she's probably some kind of CIA asset.
* Ford has received over $500,000 in a gofundme account, which she testified that she didn't know much about. She may have another gofundme account besides that.
* Ford's parents were in a home foreclosure case, and the judge who ruled against them was Brett Kavanaugh's mother.
* Ford has stated that all judges who are like Scalia should be banned from the entire US legal system. Scalia was highly respected and was a constitutional originalist or something like that. So she wants judges banned simply because they support the constitution. By the way, the US family court system does not follow the constitution and it's a really horrible, nightmarish court system that horribly persecutes men and ruins their lives and enslaves them to women. Kavanaugh is claimed to be similar to Scalia. Podesta's email messages which Seth Rich had copied from a DNC server showed that Podesta received an email talking about judge Scalia having been murdered. Seth Rich was also murdered shortly after copying emails from the DNC server and giving it to Wikileaks.
* Ford's entire family has failed to say anything in support of her to vouch for her character or her story or anything. They have been silent. Why? Because they know she's a horrible person?
* Ford lied in claiming that she's a licensed psychologist, which is illegal. She does have degrees in psychology, but she was never a licensed psychologist.
* Leland Keyser, a friend of Christine Blasey Ford who Ford [claimed was at the party](https://thepoliticalinsider.com/christine-ford-kavanaugh-witnesses/)  where she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, has not  only refuted the accuser’s version of the story, but told FBI  investigators that Ford’s “allies” tried to pressure her to change the  original version. “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no  recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present,  with, or without, Dr. Ford,” her lawyer stated under penalty of felony."

One of my issues, besides not knowing where I need to be in life, is how to avoid being surrounded by bleeding heart democrats/liberals. This is not to say I don’t want to hang out with people who don’t agree with  and that I don’t want to argue my stance. What I don’t want is a college full of very liberal professors, students, and staff. It can be exhausting and discouraging when you are surrounded by people who make you feel wrong constantly.

So, my questions:

Do I go to a liberal college and suck it up?

Conservatives in a liberal college, what is it like?

What are some good conservative colleges?

Thank you; I know I don’t always express my thoughts perfectly, so please bear with me."

I think it wouldn’t be hard as far as infrastructure goes- my phone has a pretty good camera and I have a mic I could use to record.

Anyway, you guys have any thoughts on this? Do these videos seem pretty circle jerky to you or do they actually help? I don’t want to be part of the LIBTARDS OWNED BY TRUMP SUPPORTER crowd, but I do enjoy watching the zingers that occasionally happen.

I was thinking the premise could be along the lines of the change my mind videos, most likely making a sign with a bold political statement and allowing people one at a time to discuss with me. I have a couple larger college campuses around, although they aren’t famously or overly liberal. I live near ATL as well, which definitely draws some crowds on the weekends and in the malls.

I guess I’m just not sure what kind of reactions I would get, how this would effect my current full time job, how my personal relationships with people around me would change, etc if my name ever got out there. Overall if this is something people want to see I think it would be fun, and if I could be a part of the conservative movement or even change someone’s mind it would be cool.

Has anyone attempted this? Anyone ever get fired or in trouble at their job or school?

Thanks!"

Even companies like Levi's are getting I to the mix. And while a lot of it is veiled under the guise of just a friendly ""go vote"" message, nearly all of these ads have an undertone of liberal agenda. Saying that both sides have a particular majority demographic is not racist or stereotypical, it is a fact. When you consider the demographics, and watch these ads you will primarily see women, racial minorities, immigrants, millennials, etc. and that is it. 

I will say that I disagree with the notion that the blue wave is ""over""..we still have political ""ages"" to go before the election. I'm not saying it is going to be a landslide or they are going to get nothing houses, but we absolutely should not underestimate what happens when literally (nearly) all MSM is only presenting and supporting one side. This fact honestly is what worries me the most about the future of our nation. People aren't educated anymore and don't take the time to understand government and political ideals and are just too easily influenced to believe whatever they hear if whatever they hear is liberal bullcrap, where does that leave us?

We all basically know that those of us here are going to vote and how we are going to vote but the political battle is far from certain and far from over. "

It is considered brigading on some subs so I won't link it but this is in response to a stupid post on that stupid sub 2xchromosomes which might as well call itself the pink pussy hat wailers. 

The other post had a woman crybabying about how she doesn't have the ""luxury"" of voting Republican because her health, safety, and well-being are more important than other issues and she goes off about men voting on issues like finances.

Um, that is strange because I vote Republican precisely because I care about my health, safety, and well being. Being able to sleep with a gun when the man of the house is out of state protects my health, safety, and well being. He and I both being safe from having our lives destroyed by unsubstantiated and unprovable accusations also does a lot for my health, safety, and well being. 

Her main argument that Republicans endanger her is that they will force her to have botched abortions. Hmmm. First of all, lots of legal botched abortions happen. I know because I know women whom they have happened to. Planned parenthood and the medical field are very good about covering that up. Also, isn't it the left that constantly incites women to engage in activities that will result in them desiring an abortion? Does anybody really believe that most women having abortions are doing it because of rape? I remember a post over on 2XChromosomes from a woman bragging about how she was just about to go have her first no strings attached sex with some random dude. She got lots of atta girls and like THOUSANDS of upvotes for that. If she gets pregnant from her new lifestyle of meaningless sex with random dudes, is she going to go running for an abortion or is she going to take door number two and go on welfare? How lucky for her the lefties make both options available for her. No wonder these pink pussy hat women love the Democrats. They get to live their lives totally without consequences as long as the lefties are getting their way.

The woman whining about the Republican party should be grateful that she doesn't live in a leftist country like China where she might not have the ""luxury"" to say no to an abortion as well as lots of other ""luxuries"" she wouldn't have like the luxury to share her stupid beliefs on Reddit."

Given the nature of r/Politics, you're likely to get many responses, either smug or disingenuous, usually both. Let's say you'd like to give a thoughtful response to each one. You type one, then move to the next, go to submit it aaaaaand you have to wait 5 minutes. If you actually wait that long and submit, then go to submit another, it's 8 minutes now. Meanwhile, you're possibly getting inundated with more and more dissent and downvotes without a means of defending yourself. Because of how it's set up, you getting eventually dog-piled is inevitable if you go against the grain of the subreddit's hivemind. Poor design for actually discussion."

I’m from Boston, raised Dem, and am a son of Hispanic and Irish immigrants.  They’re hardline identity politics in their support. “Blue or screw” is what I grew up hearing. I never quite agreed or felt a part of that message.  

After a successful run as a finance manager I decided to join the navy as a nuclear operations engineer, as an attempt to serve my country, and see more of the world. I loved it and quickly began to realize that there was more to the closed minded ideology of the left in which is was forced to cultivate my upbringing. Now, after retiring from the navy (early do to an overseas accident) I am an engineer in the NOVA/WV area.  I’ve learned that the sentiment is much more regional and cultural, mainly focusing in on cities, where the echo chamber constitutes a perpetual loop of multiplicity in leftist ideals.  

Roughly a year ago I began listening to podcasts. First for powerlifting and fitness and then slowly but surely I began drifting to right wing conservative podcasts like Shapiro’s and Crowder’s. I felt hope again. I realized that I was simply not aware that other people had the same feelings and thoughts I did with regard to some of the topics I viewed handled with injustice. Labeling straight white males and bad, or wrong, or inherently privileged for their whiteness was something I ardently disagreed with but heard often.  I thought of my father, son of an Irish immigrant who worked construction his whole life and struggled to support a family of five.  Where was his privilege? My mother, too proud to accept government assistance (through she and my father blindly supported the introduction of it and other dem policies) worked two jobs to help pay the bills my father struggled with.  Why didn’t our white privileged help? Additionally, cops are bad, minorities deserve special treatment because of their upbringing (even though my mother never got any being from Costa Rica), were all topics I disagreed with but was constantly force fed through apathetic fervency to be correct and just. 

 My point to all this is that I am thankful I found this sub and the conservative culture as a whole because I was beginning to feel isolated!  Not in a depressing, “im gonna lose my mind way” but more in a “come on, NO ONE really believes that BS” kind of way.  Anyway, see you in November, my conservative brother’s and sisters!  "

Mostly just didn't have time for it with everything else in life. I have always leaned conservative, but I try pretty hard to understand where other people are coming from even when we disagree.

Recently I've been listening to and liking most of what I hear from Ben Shapiro, Jordan Petersen, Victor Davis Hansen, and others. That in addition to conversations with some family and the recent insanity with Kavanaugh has convinced me I need to be more aware of the political sphere.

What I would like to know from you guys is this: If you support Trump, what exactly is it about him that you like? What has he done that you support? Is there anywhere you disagree with him? Is there anything in particular you think I should know more about?"

After the whole Kavanaugh circus, I really cannot see myself voting Democrat ever again, for reasons stated tenfold on this sub. During the whole fiasco the ACLU really showed their true colors and are no longer interested in extending and protecting the constitutional rights to all Americans. Here's my cancellation email:

>Hello,  
>  
>I've been a monthly donator to the ACLU for the last 2 years and I wish to cancel my automatic monthly donation. A couple of the main selling points of the person who signed me up was that the ACLU was a bipartisan organization that sought to extend the protections of the constitution to all people of this country. I remember being told that transgendered people could be fired simply for being transgender, with gender identity not being a protected class in many states. For these reasons I felt that the contribution was a small thing I could do to make the country a better place. I feel and still feel that protections of our constitution should be extended to all peoples of our country, no matter the color or creed.   
>  
>However, due to the recent actions surrounding Justice Kavanaugh and the ACLU's email pressers in response, it seems to me that the organization has diverted from protecting the liberties enshrined in our bill of rights for all people, namely the right to due process and presumption of innocence, to adopting a more partisan take on the issues, throwing out the rights the organization claims to protect to score political points. This is where I draw the line, and I no longer feel my contribution is going to an organization that wishes to make this country a better place for all people.

>Thank you,

To get a taste of what finally broke the camel's back, here's ACLU's summary of the Brett Kavanaugh ordeal: [https://www.aclu.org/blog/executive-branch/why-aclu-opposes-brett-kavanaughs-nomination-supreme-court](https://www.aclu.org/blog/executive-branch/why-aclu-opposes-brett-kavanaughs-nomination-supreme-court)

&#x200B;

>“The ACLU opposes the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. There are credible allegations that Judge Kavanaugh has engaged in serious misconduct that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s credible testimony, subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct, the inadequate investigation, and Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony at the hearing lead us to doubt Judge Kavanaugh’s fitness to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  
>  
>“This is not a decision taken lightly. We cannot remain silent under these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment to the highest court of the land. The standard for such an appointment should be high, and the burden is on the nominee. That burden is not met as long as there are unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assault.” 

&#x200B;

So, now that I have an extra $20/month in my pocket, what are some organizations I can donate to that actually protect the constitutional rights of Americans?

&#x200B;

Edit: can't spell ACLU

Let’s be real rightly or wrongly the women narrative thing will only be increased in the coming period. Mike Pence is about as ‘old white religious man’ as you can get.  He doesn’t help Trump at all.  He was great for conservative bonafides in 2016, but Trump has now won over vast majority of conservatives.

Putting in an extremely likeable, pleasant looking, competent and accomplished governor and statesman who happens to be a minority woman would be an absolute home run.

Despite how much winning Trump has done, I don’t think he could get it done with Pence, but would be bigger landslide than 2016 with Haley"

What struck me the most was how light-hearted he was. You really get a sense that he loves doing the rallies. But it was specifically the shit-talking that seemed so light-hearted in comparison to what's coming out from the left. At one point he flexed his arm like he was on WWE. He was making fun of an opponent, I forget who, someone claimed he was in a battle in Vietnam, so Trump pantomimed running up the hill and dodging bullets left and right. 

It's like he's talking to a child, but you know in the fun way. Telling simple stories. Clipping each idea off with a repetition. with a repetition, folks. 

Insane how this image has put the left in its position of hatred. To think! .. My theory had been the left's fatal error was focusing on propagandizing against Trump, closing off their echochambers, blinding themselves to the right's critique. How exaggerated that spiral has been, exaggerated by network effects.

The man is actually quite brilliant in a way. I found myself _wanting_ to think that, and in doing so, you find yourself _wanting_ to believe the country could be great, that everything could be awesome. 

And you can't really blame him, because he stumbled right into it. He didn't architect the left's collapse. The left is corrupted to the bone. It's visible. It needs a reset. And the idea of Donald Trump makes me believe the system can see a corrupted stack, and the natural pressure chooses someone like him. Everything naturally falls into place. We can trust ourselves. 

Maybe it's true, you know, that the future is filled with possibility."

I'm sure you've heard this before, and its true. Midterm elections always have lower turnout than Presidential elections, with only the more motivated voters showing up to the polls. Thus, whoever can get their supporters more motivated to show up will likely win, as less engaged, undecided voters are unlikely to even show up to vote.

What does this actually mean in practical terms though? Well, it means that even if you live in a deep blue state, you can make a huge difference.

Take California for example. It has only been getting bluer, and Trump did not reverse that trend. Trump was in fact deeply unpopular in California even among Republicans and Republican leaning voters. His 4.5 million votes from the state was worse than Romney did. However, its more than the 4.2 million votes the Democrats got in the 2014 midterms. What that means is that if every Trump voter showed up in 2018, the GOP could come close to the Democrats in vote totals, and actually pick up seats.

So even if you live in a blue state in a blue district, the reason why, is because you and a bunch of other Republicans showed up 2 years ago and are planning on sitting this one out. So don't. 

Its unfathomable to me that some people ""don't vote in midterms"" I've seen comments like that numerous times on this sub and I cant make any sense of it. I've only cast a ballot in 4 elections here in Canada, and only 2 of them could be described as enthusiastically. So even if you aren't thrilled with your local candidate and you dont think they'll win, show up anyway. Your vote is a signal to other conservatives sitting at home that they aren't alone, and that together you can make a difference.

Get out there and stop the Democrats."

Conservative,2018-11-06,DISCUSSION: Coastal US conservatives: Do you ever feel outnumbered... is fleeing your home state cowardly?,23,9n62hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9n62hw/discussion_coastal_us_conservatives_do_you_ever/,13,1539254406.0,"This applies equally to those stuck in California/liberal areas of Oregon and Washington, but it's mostly focused on those of us here on the East Coast, namely the Mid-Atlantic and New England. 

&#x200B;

I'm a lifelong Marylander. I love my state for our diverse terrain, our proud history of being close to the heart of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the Civil War; our world-famous Chesapeake Bay blue crabs and all the delicious meals you can make with them, and having ice-cold Natty Boh to wash it down; summer vacations down in Ocean City, driving across the Bay Bridge, visiting Sandy Point State Park, the Catoctin Mountains and Cunningham Falls, Deep Creek Lake; exploring Frederick's history of German-American settlement, Baltimore's row-homes and all of the Victorian and Edwardian-era buildings downtown, admiring Hagerstown's blue-collar spirit (Trump had a max-capacity rally there!); being the home to Johns Hopkins and the Naval Academy and Fort Detrick and Joint Base Andrews and a bunch of huge employers in the defense industry; being home to both the Redskins *and* the Ravens, and in baseball we have the Orioles, and for the other major sports we're rooting for the nearby Caps, the Wizards, DC United, etc... 

&#x200B;

I just hate being constantly outnumbered by **hordes upon hordes** of liberals, in the latest polls for the 2018 midterms, incumbent Senator Ben Cardin (D) has his Republican challenger (Tony Campbell) solidly beat by drawing 59% of the vote to Campbell's 19% if I recall correctly. I'm from rural Frederick County, so growing up I was among a solidly conservative constituency in a tight-knit community. But going to Frederick Community College and eventually getting a great-paying job in neighboring Montgomery County, I feel like I'm more alienated from society by seeing hundreds of thousands of people blindly embrace liberalism so readily. It's not even an ethic thing, I see more snobby white liberal yuppies than anything, with their ""RESIST"" stickers and their Clinton stickers on their car from the 2016 election. People around here are so quick to accept open-borders advocacy, pro-abortion and pro-LGBT stances, anti-2nd Amendment legislation, and they will jump down your throat with hatred if you question the ""Trump/Russia collusion"" narrative. For me, voting for Trump and seeing him get elected was a dream come true... but Maryland still turned out for Clinton, 60.5% to 35.3%. I sure as hell did my part, I spread the word on social media. I waved signs outside polling places on primary day, I voted early in both the primary and the general elections. I even got cussed-out and had my car vandalized by random strangers. (Nobody tried punching me though, I'm like 6'2"" and 220. I'm a pretty physically imposing dude in-person.)

&#x200B;

Is it because more of them are Federal agency pencil-pushers, and therefore feel bound to vote for Democrats who're going to ""refill the swamp"" rather than drain it? Or is it the fact that lucrative Federal contracts draw legions of corporate white-collar yuppies... but if that's the case, why is Montgomery County and nearby Northern Virginia so damn left-lib/progressive leaning? You'd think moving up the ladder of social mobility would turn them more right-leaning, right? It's a big enough problem that I've been voting my whole adult life (since the 2010 midterms) and I can't recall ever having helped contribute to making a single damn dent in the Democrats' monolithic foothold here in MD. The only reason we got Larry Hogan elected governor is because he's a massive RINO who gives the Democrats ground on basically anything (gun control, immigration enforcement) despite claiming to be a ""bipartisan moderate"". 

&#x200B;

I know quite a few conservatives who have registered as Democrat; to either shift the tide of the Democratic Party back to ""blue dog"" Democrats like Jim Webb (who I honestly like, and wanted to see as Trump's running mate in 2016), or at the very least to vote for the more extreme Democrats during the primaries to throw a wrench into the gears. But to me that doesn't feel right, I like being able to vote Republican (we have a closed-primary system) in the primaries and actually have a say in our party's candidates. Either way, we always get creamed during the general election. At this rate, I'm strongly considering jumping ship when my wife and I can afford a home outside the state, possibly in nearby Pennsylvania or West Virginia. Somewhere away from the liberal lunacy of the D.C. suburbs and the Annapolis elites... 

&#x200B;

I just hate the idea of ""cutting and running"" from my home state, does anyone else struggle with the same decision? (Plus it would make my nearly hour-long commute an hour-and-a-half or two hours!) Especially those of you reading this from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Washington, Oregon, etc. I know a lot of conservative New Jersey-ites are moving to PA, and a lot of conservative Californians are escaping to Nevada and Arizona. I also want to live in a state where my vote actually matters, and actually helps get pro-Trump, pro-MAGA Republicans elected. Part of why I hate living in Maryland is because I feel like my vote is like basically like trying to absorb the Atlantic Ocean with a kitchen sponge. But at the same time... home is home, and Maryland will always be ""home"" to me. Does anyone else struggle with this? Plus, with all the hostility in today's political climate and battle lines being drawn, I kinda feel like if SHTF, my family and I will be in the hot zone. 

&#x200B;

Thank you all so much, I hope this doesn't come off as a rant. "

Now that Trump is visiting my fiancé and a lot of my friends are outraged at the campus and I am trying my best to hold my tongue and try to understand them but their outrage isn’t really based in anything other than their hate of the right. Let me say that I love my fiancé very much and we’ve both believed that politics not be what drives a relationship but hearing her complain with these leftist points is very off putting for me and I don’t want to belittle her by just dismissing everything she believes is false. Any opinions on this matter because I’m sure I’m not the only one in this situation. 

Edit: when I say I’m closeted I mean to my friends, my fiancé is aware that I have conservative view points just not to what extent. So we have had political conversations I’m just trying to show some restraint and not tell her everything she believes in is wrong and she shouldn’t think that, don’t want to sound like the libs. "

Conservative,2018-11-06,"To anyone who doesn't get why we have an electoral college, and why it's essential to our nation.",0,9nm0mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9nm0mg/to_anyone_who_doesnt_get_why_we_have_an_electoral/,1,1539392401.0,"Why have an electoral college and not a straight democracy? In short, a democracy isn't a fair system. A democracy doesn't protect individual rights. We are not really one people, we're, just like the name implies, a group of 50 states united under one form of government and language (sorta). The difference in the cultures of NYC and Chamblee, GA are as disparate as any two nations in other parts of the world. There's even blatantly obvious difference in the languages we use. I grew up in NYC and left for Augusta, GA when I was 17. I assure you, none of my friends in NYC ever used the words, ""y'all,"" ""fixin'"", or reckon"" once, couldn't escape it in Augusta. All these people exist under a government which exists largely because we were pissed about taxation without representation. So our founders saw fit to assure these individual colonies maintained their proportional representation in the single government they were forming. So how do you do that when the vast majority of people live in urban centers and the vast majority of the country is sparsely populated agricultural land? How does North Dakota become as well represented as California (using today's conditions for argument's sake)? By using congressional districts in our House of Representatives, and giving each of the states two seats in the Senate. Good, that's one of our ruler's rules set down that's actually fair to the various populations of the individual states. Then there's the judiciary, how do we get our top judges, who themselves shall have an equal place among the rulers of our people? Have the Chief Executive, and hold on, we're coming to him, appoint them, and have Senate act as a buffer to the process. Now we have a system where we have a proportional voice and that voice gives us veto power over who will sit and judge us. 

Now to that Chief Executive, isn't that what we came here for in the first place? But he doesn't stand alone. He has immense power over the direction of the country and each person deserves to have a proportional voice in selecting who that is. So how do we do that? If we did that by a direct popular vote, aka, democracy, the selection would fall into the hands of the Tri-State Area around NYC, Southern California, Dallas, and Chicago. Nebraska, Iowa, Utah, both Dakotas, etc. would have zero voice in who our president would be. Their interests, even if approved by Congress, would be easily vetoed by a president who is only answerable to a few densely populated areas. Did you notice how many times Trump stumped in Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Florida, etc? Because those people get to have a proportional voice over who the President will be. The way to give the individual an equal voice is to slice it into the smallest pieces we have, House districts. Each house district gets one vote and each Senator gets one vote based on the popular votes of their areas. This way each ~711,000 (according to Google) gets a single vote no matter where they live. 


TL;DR And this is why we have an electoral college, to give each citizen a fair, proportional vote and not have it drowned out by small regions with a dense population and a shared culture. 

KAG! Vote in the mid-terms."

It has made errors, and it is absolutely conservative in the mainstream conservative manner that can be found in American households across America.  The errors made by Breitbart needed to be pulled and corrected.

That out of the way, many of the issues within Breitbart that caused concern among the right are essentially entirely removed.  The taste for the “alt-right”, which was and remains a tiny group with a negligible number of adherents, has almost entirely be pulled.  Troubling people like Milo Yiannopoulos and Steve Bannon have left the website and have no presence there anymore.  I will not lie, for well over a year, I had determined not to read, use, or post the website on this subreddit.  I considered it too troubling.

However, those who have been too close to those sources are now gone.  I have made a point to post articles from Breitbart when I see articles I like, just like I do from Fox News, Daily Wire, PJ Media, and National Review.  At this point, the Breitbart is effectively no different, and there is no evidence that it’s articles are any more ""troubling"" than those other websites.

You who are on here are under no requirement to like Breitbart, but since changes in leadership, the complaints that Breitbart is “invalid” or “racist” will not be heard.  It has *entirely* returned to its hard-hitting and mainstream Conservative roots as imagined by its founder, the late, great, Andrew Breitbart.

You are wasting our time by complaining about it, and if you’re a leftist, you’ll almost certainly be banned."

**Toss-up LOSSES for Republicans**:

CA-10:  It's a narrow Clinton/Obama district and the only polling data shows the dem +5 ahead of the incumbant Rep.  Plus it's Cali...

CA-25:  Clinton narrowly won even though Romney won by 6.7%.   Dem is an attractive blond woman, I'd say he loses this narrowly based on the polls.

CA-39:  Another similar district to 25.  Polling gives the Rep a chance here for sure, but I think it's a loss given the partisan balance and the state involved here.  Plus no incumbency advantage here, it's an open seat.

CA-45:  Another similar one with a R incumbent this time.  Polling is worse, this seems more reliably a loss than the last one.

IL-6:  Clinton outperformed Romney by 15% here.  Too many country club snobby RINOs who love the Koch Bros to win imho even though the Rep is +1% in the polls and he has incumbency advantage.

KS-3:  Clinton narrowly won it, Romney won it easily.  Two polls show this is a loss for Reps.  If we somehow hold this the Reps will be having a very good night indeed.

NC-9:  Trump/Romney won it both by 11.6%, but the polling isn't great for the incumbent.  The two most recent polls have him at an average of 43.5%, even though one poll has him ahead by 5%.  I'd say the probabilities are narrowly against him here despite the partisan advantage, he should be polling above 45% as a known quantity.  However I'll be excited if we somehow hold this one.

NJ-7:  Clinton narrowly won a Romney district.  Incumbent behind 3%, narrow loss.

NV-3:  No incumbent advantage, Trump only won by 1%, Obama won by 1%.  Only poll shows Dem ahead by 2%, but the sample size is shit.  This one looks lost to me regardless though.  But it was a Dem seat to begin with, so no partisan net change if dems hold.

PA-1:  Lost, narrowly won by clinton/obama, polls are close but the more recent one is is negative.  Incumbent advantage insufficient.




**Narrow toss-up WINS for Republicans**:

CA-48:  Narrow Clinton win, big Romney win, but I'm giving this to the Reps based on incumbency advantage and the polling.

FL-26:  Hispanic incumbent Rep vs white seems like he is holding this seat based on polling despite the partisan leaning of the district to D's.  If this one is lost early in the night Reps may lose house (I'm obviously uncertain we can hold this one).

FL-27:  Same story as FL-26, Hispanic Rep is up by 2%.  But would not be surprised to lose this one early on election night.

IA-3:  Trump outperformed Obama here by 7%, plus incumbency advantage, plus polling that isn't that bad.  Narrow hold here by a few percent.

IL-12:  Trump massively outperformed Romney, this is a MAGA district with the Rep narrowly ahead in the only poll.  Plus incumbent advantage.  I just don't see this one going D.

IL-14:  Decent poll with the incumbent up +4%, plus Trump/Romney won it by 4% and 10% respectively.

KS-2:  Massive MAGA district Trump won by 18%, Romney won by 14%.  It's open and the polls are close, but I just can't see them overcoming a partisan advantage of that magnitude.  Plus it's Kansas, comon.

KY-6:  MAGA territory, Trump and Romney easily won by like 13-15%.  Incumbent Rep holding a narrow poll lead near 47%.  Not sure why the only polling is showing such a close race, but it's only a single poll.  If we lose this one, we're probably done for in the House.

ME-2:  MAGA territory, Trump outperformed Obama here by 19%.  Poll looks good for the Rep.

MI-8:  Trump outperformed Romney and easily won by 6.7%.  Polls are solid enough to count this a narrow win for the Rep incumbent.

NC-13:  Trump +9%, Romney +7%.  Rep incumbent is ahead in two polls by a decent margin.  Narrow hold.

NJ-3:  Trump +6, Obama +5.  Partisan advantage of +11, polling is close, but not close enough to give this one to the Dems.  Plus incumbent advantage.

NM-2:  Trump +10, Romney +7.  Given Trump over-performance and small Rep advantage in polling, I'd say we hold this open district.

NY-19:  Partisan advantage of R 13% too strong for dems to take this despite the narrow polls.  The samples are too small imo to give them much weight.  Polls are also very old.  Incumbent narrowly wins re-election.

NY-22:  Same story as last one, but slightly stronger for Reps based on partisan advantage of 16%.

TX-7:  Clinton won this one narrowly, but Romney carried it by a whopping 22%.  That means the partisan advantage is 21% R.  These people are obviously cuckservatives, but they'll probably re-elect their incumbent R.  Poll is +3% for Rep at 48%.  

TX-23:  Similar cuckservative story here, weak for Trump, but super strong for Romney.  R incumbent narrowly ahead in the only poll at 48%.  I have no idea what's wrong with my fellow Texans here.

UT-4:  Strongest cuckservative story of the election night.  Trump +6.7, Romney +37.  Polls show Rep narrowly ahead, should be a win, but it shouldn't be this close...

VA-5:  No polling data, no incumbent, but Trump outperformed Romney by a lot.  These people are MAGA.  They won't vote D imho.

VA-6:  Trump won by 6.5, Romney 10.5.  Slightly cucky here, Rep incumbent with 2% lead.  I see a narrow hold here.

WA-8:  This one seems to defy the trend more than any I've seen.  Narrowly won by Clinton and Obama, but the Rep incumbent is ahead by 10% in the latest poll.  Average of last two polls shows 5.5% lead.  However newer data is desperately needed.  I won't be surprised if this one is lost, but as of now I can't give to to the dems quite yet.

So I was wondering what changes, if any, that you'd make. 

Personally, I'd probably add to the 3rd Amendment that government cannot force ANY wartime behavior of its citizenry. No sedition acts or forced drafting of citizens. I'm a patriot, but even during wartime, we ought to volunteer to help our country because it's a good country. We shouldn't be forced. That's tyranny. That's government owning us. That's backwards.

FACT: The FBI and President Obama’s Justice Department had specific, corroborated evidence to back up allegations that Senator Menendez had sex with underage girls in the Dominican Republic.

FACT: The FBI also discovered a “black book” listing Menendez 9 separate times alongside the names and phone numbers of multiple women in what an FBI agent testified looked to be a ledger of prostitution activity.

FACT: The pilot of Menendez’s friend, convicted felon Salomon Melgen, also testified he flew “young girls” who “look[ed] like escorts” on Melgen’s plane. In addition, the FBI confirmed that young women who received substantial sums of money from Dr. Melgen were at Casa De Campo at the same time as Menendez.

FACT: Confronted with the FBI’s corroborating evidence that placed Menendez in the same place at the same time the alleged sex with underage victims took place, Menendez lied. The Obama DOJ called his denials “demonstrably false.” Menendez and his legal team argued in federal court documents that these allegations, even if true would hardly be a crime.

However I do find myself leaning conservative on most issues both socially and economically. My question is regarding tax brackets in the 1950s vs now. There was a 90% bracket back then and it appears as though that’s the time liberals at the very least say republics yearn for. I don’t know whether or not that is true and that is really the core of my question. First of all do conservatives feel nostalgia for the economy of the 1950s and if so what is the opposition to the tax brackets of that time and why are those tax brackets considered anti capitalist when they weren’t then?

Conservative,2018-11-06,An American Catharsis,1,9p0nly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9p0nly/an_american_catharsis/,0,1539825527.0,"  

Having signed up for a new internet community service, ""Free Talk 24""(freetalk24.com, created by One America News Network), my adventure into user posts began. Along the way I encountered threads discussing the state of America. People from all over, posting meme's, support for President Trump, presentation's summarizing the new administrations successes, and the unending evidence of the past administration’s failures, corruption, lies all evidence of the Democrats attempt to destroy our country. 

As middle-aged naturalized American's my wife and I watch, listen and read vigorously about our Country. Prior to the 2016 election we found ourselves without much hope, at times discussing where we can move outside of our Country if Hillary won the upcoming election. For many years we had watched the dismantling of our America. When Trump won the election a new hope stirred, we were wide eyed and optimistic. It seemed there might be hope after all, for the first time in decades we felt cautious optimism. For so long we've felt imprisoned by our Government, slowly sheading our freedoms and rights, more and more strangled by the system. Such dark day's passing one by one, edict's flowing from the highest seat in the land, subverting our founder's design for our Republic. As I write this reflecting on how we felt prior to Trump's victory I'm realizing the depth of despair set upon us, terrifying (my poor children), in some way this looming fear of our own Government must be how the 2.5 million colonists must have felt before armed conflict broke out. 

Here I sit, grasping onto faith that was instilled in my youth, once again we the people, finally have a citizen statesman leading the Republic. Inspiration is an odd feeling, having felt so helpless for so long, in some way writing this, which started as a response to one of the posting on freetalk24.com, has turned into a surge of catharsis. What follows is where my response began, the opening may seem random, at the time one of the posts spoke of an enemy, some undefinable entity that has materialized, built and become more aggressive in my lifetime. Is this what a REVELATION feels like? Writing this I realize why I've felt so vulnerable and small for so long, this concealed entity has slowly revealed a complete system, judicial, religious, political, social, economic, executive (Obama) and as its final targeted takeover military component's. Thank god our military is the last bastion of Patriotism that have battled and refused to surrender America.

""They"" were and still are in many ways very close to establishing a complete centralized state, in our case a deep state. This ""State"" within our nation is embedded within the ""Acronym Agencies"", i.e. EPA, DHHS, FCC, FAA, FDA, DOD, FBI, and so on. Not accountable or elected by we the people. With a Social Justice (socialism by any other name) agenda these supposed American's employ the power of the state against their opponents (DOD or IRS pursue you if you're not on their plantation), a Fascist authoritarian suppression of an opponent. Recent leaders have rented and sold American policy, intellectual property and state secrets, a systematic war to dismantle our Republic, of course enriching themselves in the process.

As much as our own success and blessings have allowed American apathy to flourish, we have been the victims of an assault, an organized media propaganda campaign to nurture apathy and hopelessness in our citizens. Our country is at war, a covert war waged within our own politic body, the enemy is embedded at every level of our government and the media. Their goal is clear, to destroy our Republic. Globalization, destroy national sovereignty, create national debt and a financial crisis, force open borders and mass immigration, permanently destroy our culture, dismantle the American family, those that don't assimilate will be silenced.

From out of nowhere our last best hope has been delivered, a citizen statesman in our highest office. Trump is well aware of the corrupt enemy that is embedded within our branches of government. He has a plan to get control back, to punish those responsible and ultimately to expose and win the covert war to usurp our constitution. 

Our President's authority is decentralized, designed by our framers to act with neither efficiency nor dispatch. It is obvious the so-called political parties are in conflict. The House of Representatives and the Senate must be empowered to support our Chosen President's righteous task, to return our government to the people. Separate institutions sharing power in this time of war must coalesce, put aside their rivalries and cooperate to once again reestablish our federalist Republic. 

In this time, our task to root out the corrupt elected and unelected bureaucrat's requires citizens to VOTE their value's not their party. Due to the mass propaganda effort some might have difficulty even defining the values our founders embedded at the core of our country. Let us reflect historically on some of our nations divinely inspired values your VOTE is fighting for.

1. We value that all men being born free are endowed with rights to life and liberty; each individual's right to life is inviolable; each individual's liberty is considered an unalterable aspect of the human condition.

2. We value our creator who endowed us with unalienable rights, truth is at the core each right, all men are equal under these righteous truths.

3. We value each citizen having the right to pursue happiness unhampered.

4. We value the right to speak and express ourselves freely.

5. We value the right to freely exercise religious diversity.

6. We value and protect property rights where people can freely acquire, use, and dispose of personal property.

7. We the people give government it's powers for this strictly limited purpose of securing citizens' rights, the government shall have limited power which protect the rights of all citizens.

8. We value individual Liberty, we are free to think, speak and act independently.

9. We value the common good and community welfare.

10. We value due process in the pursuit of justice, protected from denial or delay of justice.

11. We value self-governance, of the people, by the people, for the people.

12. We value Individual identity is held sacred and that dignity and integrity should not be violated

13. We value that to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness.

14. We value that all citizens have political and legal equality, treated as equals before the law we are not to be denied these rights unless by due process of law.

15. We value the reasonable expectation of privacy.

16. We value states having an equal voice in the senate and each state's influence in selecting the President as protected by our founder’s grand federal design that respects the sovereign role of states via the Electoral College.

17. We value strictly limited government, Federalism's separation of powers between our three branches of government, the bi-cameral legislation (House of Representatives & Senate), Executive and judicial. We value checks and balances between each branch to limit the powers of the others.

18. We value the right of the people to keep and bear arms, not to be infringed. We value the right to keep and bear arms to defend against mob rule, government tyranny and for the purpose of self-defense.

19. We value true justice, a fair and equal system of rules and laws, administered with fairness and equality for all 

20. We value our citizens common defense by our government from another country or nation.

21. We value domestic tranquility, living in a peaceful society where common people are protected.

In many ways our liberties, freedoms and values have already fallen victim in this covert war within America. Marxism has penetrated all levels of government agencies, especially the central bureaucracy. Whereas in the past the Federal Government was not involved in the education system, it is now predominant. Our children have been under attack, the education system has effectively been captured and is now doing the bidding of the enemy, threatening the future of our nation. Socialism, atheism, evolution, economic determinism, anti-traditional framework of sex and family, moral relativism and communism are all a part of the new American curriculum, taught every day in schools across America. This tactic has impacted every grade level even higher education. Destruction and corruption of the American education system has come to pass.

""Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of the teachers' associations. Put the party line in text books."", The naked communist, W. Cleon Skousen. Goal achieved!

Our country is being changed from within, this is your wakeup call. You are at war, whether you want it or not, you have no choice in this matter. America has been under attack for multiple generations, Sun Tzu would be proud, avoid strength attack weakness! America is likely the most transparent and open society on the planet. America's immigration, education and political systems are all identifiable weaknesses. Each of these systems has been used to penetrate our country from within. Elected officials are not required to have a background check once elected, they only need be a citizen for nine years, meet an age requirement and live in the state they wish to serve. Simple, yet effective, immigrate, run for office, serve in any capacity and continue moving up, rinse and repeat with 100's of agents. Now you have multiple levels of control within the American government. Influence and change culture, policies and laws. Alternatively, the enemy can also purchase corrupt traitors of America to do their bidding in the halls of power, with the same outcome. Infiltrate the education system using similar methods, accomplished much easier. Change literature, curriculum, and campus culture. Influence America's youth for generations, prepare the youth for communist and socialist agendas. Use the youth to advocate for the same agenda's, use the youth to create mobs, riots, atrocities and other public discord. This has already come to pass.

American's must realize the current battlespace, it is far reaching, well beyond this summary level text. Acknowledging we are active participant's in a covert war is a starting point. The next step is to take active steps taking a counter offensive where possible. This operation has bad actors within our own government, our own education system and in some cases our children have been turned against us. This seriously limits viable alternatives to fight back. Right now, we have a unique opportunity. Mid-term elections are right around the corner, your VOTE is the first salvo as a warrior of freedom.

1.5 million American's have died wearing America's uniform since the founding of our country. This is your chance to be a warrior for our freedom, stomp on your complacency, shred your apathy, have faith in yourself and your countrymen, we can and will be victorious. Our American spirit may have been sleeping, but you can feel it waking, let it roar! In appreciation of our Liberty, the greatness of America we must fight, each and every one of us. Fight for yourself, for your children, for your countrymen, we must be victorious! 

Attention soldier, your direct fire weapon is your VOTE. You finally have an effective weapon in this prolonged battle. Vote your values not your party, these values are shared by everyone in our nation. Values are not party centric, this nation was organized based on our founders’ values, they are embedded in the fabric of this country, in your community, in the constitution, the bill of rights and declaration of independence. 

To achieve victory, we have to enable our president to enact the policies necessary to retake our country. We must not vote party lines, contemplate your principals, values, beliefs, ethics, and moral virtues. 

Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth. we must be engaged, WAKE UP, DRAW YOUR VOTING WEAPON, fire the KILL vote (shot) that will enable the retaking of our country. Vote Republican align the 3 branches of government, eliminate the resistance, deny the obstructionist, cease the delays, stop the destruction of our Country, VOTE REPUBLICAN."

#Next week... Just weeks before the midterm elections, on October 26 – 28, the first #WalkAway march is slated to take place.   

#The March will begin at the DNC and end up in front of our nation’s capitol.   

#This March route was deliberately chosen to have participants *literally* walking away from the Democrat Party!

#It’s time for the Silent Majority to become unsilent. Arrive on Friday, October 26th & have dinner with us. We'll have a march & rally on DC on Saturday, October 27th, & have brunch on Sunday, October 28th.  

#For more information about the march, they’ve set up an excellent website: [walkawaymarch.com](https://walkawaymarch.com)  
 

#The [walkawaymarch](https://walkawaymarch.com) website includes a great new video by Straka titled: [It’s Time. The #WalkAway March on Washington](https://youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=LKUlrfCWSQQ), and is definitely worth checking out.

*****    

#Here is the full transcript of the video which was the source for the Sidebar Tribute quote:  

Once upon a time, I was a liberal. 

Well, to be honest, less than a year ago, I was still a liberal. 

I became a liberal because I felt I’d found a tribe whose values aligned with my own. 

I staunchly reject racism of any kind, I reject the marginalization of any human being based off of their gender or sexual orientation. I reject tyrannical group think, I reject a system which allows an ambitious, misinformed, and dogmatic mob to suppress free speech, create false narratives, and apathetically steamroll over the truth. 

I reject the acceptance of junk science and superstition to advance ideological agendas.

I reject hate. 

These are the reasons why I became a liberal and these are the same reasons why I am now walking away.

**For years now, I have watched as the left has devolved into intolerant, inflexible, illogical, hateful, misguided, ill-informed, un-American, hypocritical, menacing, callous, ignorant, narrow-minded, and at times, blatantly fascistic behavior and rhetoric.**

**Liberalism has been co-opted and absorbed by the very characteristics it claims to fight against. For years now, I've watched as people on the left have become anesthetized to their own prejudices and bigotry and the prejudices and bigotry of those around them who echo their values. I have watched these formerly-sensible people, who claim to reject racism, have come to embrace the principles of universally hating and blaming all of society's problems on all people who have white skin. I have witnessed the irony of advocacy for gender equality morph into blatant hatred and intolerance of men and masculinity. I have seen the once-earnest fight for equality for the LGBT community mutate into an illogical demonization of heteronormativity and the push to vilify and attack our conventional concepts of gender.** 

**These same self-proclaimed victims of intolerance [are] now turning on the gay community that they once attached themselves to advance their agenda, [are] now calling gay people 'privileged' and themselves 'victims' of injustice. I have watched as the left has allowed themselves to become hypnotized by false narratives and conclusions, perpetuated by social justice warriors who misrepresent and misconstrue facts and evidence and events to confirm their own biases that everyone who does not comply with their prejudicial conclusions and follow their orders is a racist, a bigot, a Nazi, a white supremacist, homophobic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, misogynist, and alt-right extremist. And I've watched as they've used these heartless and carelessly-assigned labels to intimidate, threaten, bully, silence, attack, un-employ, blacklist, and destroy anybody who dares to fight back.** 

**They'll come for me and then they'll come for you.** 

And worst of all, the Democratic Party and the liberal media has embraced, affirmed, aided, and abetted this cult ideology. In an effort to gain voters and maintain power, the Democratic Party that I once loved has joined forces with the extremist left. The Democratic Party and the liberal media now believe their own ill-gotten conclusions and have ominously decided that they –and only they – know the remedy for society's ills. 

The Left has decided that the solution to problems with race relations in America is more racism. The Left believes that attacking, insulting, and dehumanizing one group of people elevates another. The Left now believes that there are no boundaries when telling lies, omitting the truth, or misrepresenting the facts when telling the news because their end justifies their means. The Left has now decided that its point of view is the only acceptable one and that suppressing, censoring, and banning open debate is virtuous and progressive. The Democratic Party has adopted a deleterious belief system, happily and without skepticism, separating people into groups based off of identity and then organizing them into camps of 'victims' and 'oppressors.' 

If you are a person of color, an LGBT person, a woman, or an American immigrant, the Democratic Party wants you to know that you are a victim and destined to stay that way. They will insist that you are a victim doomed to exist within a system that is rigged against you, that you are a victim of systemic oppression, that you are a victim of your circumstances, and that no amount of hard work or motivational action will ever allow you to overcome your victimhood or the privilege of those around you. 

This is perhaps the Democratic Party's greatest and most insidious lie. 

But if you are a minority in America today, the left-wing politicians and the liberal media don't ever want you to ever discover this lie. So they bombard us with stories designed to reinforce this narrative that you are in danger, that you cannot succeed. They manipulate your fears and concerns by telling you that you are disadvantaged, disempowered, and disposable to everyone – except to them. They will tell you that you need them. They will tell you that you are only safe under their supervision. They will promise to liberate you from all that chains you. 

And then, they will do absolutely nothing for you. 

**Once upon a time I was a liberal. But liberalism has changed. And I will no longer be a part of an ideology or political party that represents everything that contradicts my values of unity, equal opportunity, personal empowerment, compassion, and love.** 

**So I am walking away.** 

**And I encourage all of you to do the same**. 

**Walk away.**

I think it's ridiculous that when Republican politicians talk about entitlement programs, they're kind of dancing around the point. Paul Ryan goes ""Oh, SS is overburdened and causing so much debt!"" The fact is that's hardly relevant compared to the fact that entitlement is by its very nature immoral and should be eliminated because it's wealth redistribution which is wrong

2. Everytime a leftist says ""tax cuts are only allowing XYZ to keep their money it doesn't benefit everyone"" instead of bothering explaining the economic benefits of tax cuts, the argument should be ""Well, that's the point. Everyone is entitled to their own money. The economic benefits that may or may not happen are incidental. We do not have the right to keep separating people from their money."""

Why I never voted before:  because I did not want to support a broken system that I felt was not the republic we were founded on and had the mentality, if they want to burn it let them.

Why I voted: hands down Kavanaugh, the way the Dems acted was deplorable and while apart me still thinks others control the outcome...and votes dont matter.  I couldnt take the chance I was wrong.

That's right the gain for Republicans in seats means more to me than the last Presidential election.

Happy Trump won, actual good is being done the media wont talk about.

In those 5 hours it had 33,000 views, 614 comments, 1293 points, and was 94% upvoted.  At the time it was removed it was the top post on r/Canada

As for not relating to Canada I would like to point out the following:

*It was in a National newspaper.

*It talks about book banning with affects everyone.

*It affects Peel Region which has a population of 1.3 million, and the school board itself has 154,000 students.

It seems to me that if we can have multiple posts on r/Canada about a house accidentally being cleaned in Halifax, we can have a post that affects that many people.

I am posting this on multiple subreddits as I hate censorship and crap like this needs to be called out."

And also classical housewifery as a business has gone all but extinct, here's a video explaining this.

https://youtu.be/In8jWBlc8xo?list=PLUJRNP3fcS6354sWHv-bY5mA2IZv7Ihe0&t=239

Ok now that you got some proper context to what happened, here's how I think they will return if they do, and why I think the internet will play an instrumental role in this. clothing making and food production has been industrialized, and the ladies' way of doing things has gone obsolete. But what about online activities and jobs? The artists? The writers? The YouTubers? And other jobs that can and are done on the internet?

So the stay at home Moms will return via internet! And many values will come back with the rise of the Online Housewife! They're virtually not there, but can still raise the kids right!"

&#x200B;

I've heard many conservative talk about how government-run healthcare and school, despite free, is horrible in quality, I kinda see that in Hong Kong and Taiwan (places where I live). 

Hong Kong has free education for everyone, in my opinion , it's mediocre at best. Not only ""going to school"" is mandatory,  the quality of education materials(like books and computers) are usually really mediocre and sometimes being use as propaganda by the government (teachers are terrible too sometimes).

&#x200B;

Taiwan has universal-kind-of healthcare I think, they call it ""all-citizen"" healthcare, you need to be a citizen or student to get that healthcare. It covers all payment that in that healthcare program like checkup ,some surgeries and medicines. The quality of care isn't great but acceptable in my opinion, the healthcare program doesn't cover all the treatment, if you want better treatment, you have to pay with your cash, usually those treatments have really high price tag. We don't have   
many horrible stories regard to said healthcare program, part of the reason, in my opinion, is Taiwan medias are usually   
pretty bias, however, a recent report showed that ""all-citizen"" healthcare system is losing too much money and could be shutdown in the next couple of years.

&#x200B;

My question is why government-run free healthcare and education system usually have difficultly maintaining and improving its quality, as we see in Taiwan, Hong Kong and most of Europe?"

Conservative,2018-11-06,I voted Democrat most of my life. Not anymore. This is my #walkaway.,619,9q6i1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9q6i1y/i_voted_democrat_most_of_my_life_not_anymore_this/,125,1540179975.0,"I'm posting this on a throwaway because I mostly only participate in gaming subs, including being a mod of a moderately sized one on my main account, and have some information on there that could potentially be used to dox me. That's been happening to people too much lately and since I really don't feel like taking the chance of getting doxxed by political crazies for a simple opinion, I figured making a new account to post this would be best. I'm sure I'll probably get called out by people on the left for it, but whatever, I felt like I really needed to share this and lately they usually believe whatever they want to believe anyway lol.

For most of my life I probably would have considered myself center-left on the political spectrum and have voted mostly for Democrats, with a couple of Republican governors and state reps sprinkled in. I was always raised to believe in things like equal rights for all, helping one another whenever possible, commitment to the truth, and compromise. I guess I've always thought, for the most part, that Democrats best represented those qualities. But over the past year or so I've come to see that just isn't the case anymore.

Since Trump was elected, Democrat politicians have shown to be increasingly combative on almost every single issue, and usually just for the sake of being combative! So many things in this country still need to get done and Democrats continuously refuse to compromise. It's honestly a miracle that Trump has gotten as much done as he has with the stonewalling from Democrats. I just can't bring myself to side with a party that puts itself before their country any longer.

Another thing that has increasingly concerned me about the left is how radical their voting base has become. Antifa is violent and out of control. Other liberals hold marches and protests that shut down public streets every weekend just for the sake of attention and not any real issues. You just don't see that level of unhinged from the right. I worry that if it grows large enough and more of these people gain power that it could lead us down the path to socialism. While I still believe in having some form of basic social safety net, what these people want is pure and total socialism. We need to keep our sanity and not let this country end up like Venezuela.

I think the straw that finally broke the camel's back though was the Kavenaugh hearings. The politicians and people on the left jumped on completely uncorroborated allegations as if they were cold hard truth. Republicans gave them every opportunity to come up with real proof, including an FBI investigation and they could not do it. I think this event more than any other perfectly showed to me who the real party of truth and objectivity was.

Those being the major reasons, I will not be voting for Democrat candidates anymore and this is my #walkaway from that party. Maybe somewhere down the road, when some semblance of sanity and civility returns to that party I can reconsider my stance, but I won't be holding my breath.

[**Edit:**](https://i.redd.it/j58rudiuuer11.jpg) Wow! Already the #2 post, I can't believe all the attention this has gotten! Oh wait lol yes I can because holy shit you chuds are so fucking gullible (except for u/sirjag, well done) and will believe any bullshit that will conform to your preconceived worldview. A little disappointed I couldn't beat out the megachud proud boy post at #1 though... I promised to hire a dozen more MS-13 illegals if it did but I'll settle for voting 50 times for AOC instead. WalkAway is right-wing astroturf. All cops are bastards. Communism will win. Conservatives are genetically predisposed to violence. Pee is stored in the balls."

This was my first time voting conservative. I am in MA in a very blue town, I honestly panicked and asked for a blue ballot then wrote in all my Republican candidates.

Cowardly I know, but I was taken aback. Republicans are treated like pariahs in my town, and the ladies giving out the ballots were people I knew.

My question: should I expect a similar situation at these midterms? I absolutely am voting Red all the way. I guess I should come out of the closet lol. But I thought this was all supposed to be way more confidential...I was shocked. 

Thanks."

I am a young conservative (age 17) and I was wondering if anyone could provide me with some good resources to learn about basic economics. I don't mean extremely basic supply-demand explanations; rather, a more in-depth look at how wealth is generated through capitalism so that I can explain this type of thing to my conservative friends who, although they consider themselves fiscally conservative, don't have a great enough understanding of a free market economy to shield themselves from leftist social-democracy rhetoric. (I was once very disappointed in a fellow conservative who believed the rich should be taxed more, only to find myself unable to fully articulate to him why that sort of thing is undesirable)

Conservative,2018-11-06,I’m a DACA recipient and have been a PROUD conservative for years. AMA!,0,9r0zvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9r0zvm/im_a_daca_recipient_and_have_been_a_proud/,1,1540425955.0,"I was brought here legally when I was five years old and then fell out of status by overstaying a tourist visa. I quickly adapted to the American way of life, learned to speak English, deeply studied the history of this country, and did my best. Fun fact: I was the only student in a class of 60 to get a 5 on the AP United States History exam in high school. One of the coolest moments of my youth, and it happened during a deep bout of shame shortly after I found out I was undocumented.

When I was eighteen, I had the choice to leave and go back to my birth country. I loved the USA too much and couldn’t part with it. I understand many of you will think that, in order to be philosophically consistent, I should have left as soon as I was able, and I respect that. I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. 

I do think DACA was an overreach of executive power. I think the President does have the right to prioritze enforcement more or less in certain areas, but the creation of social programs is not within his rights. I accepted it to contribute to my household and work, which I couldn’t do before that. 

I believe the Democratic Party panders to the poor and to immigrant families because they know that these people come from socialist or socialist-leaning countries and will vote Democrat when naturalized. It makes me sick.

God-willing, I’ll likely be getting married next year to my girlfriend and eventually naturalized. The day I become a US citizen will easily be one of the proudest moments of my life. My children will never forget how God smiled on them by letting them be born here.

When the day comes that I can finally vote, I’ll be voting for the Party that trusts Americans with their own money, protects our rights to defend ourselves against tyranny, and stands up for the family unit.

If for whatever reason I’m deported, even if it’s by this administration, I have NO RIGHT to hate this country or complain. It gave me an incredible upbringing, education and memories. I have a college degree that would surge me into the top 1% wherever I go. 

Don’t let the left fool you: there are immigrants on the right that love this country and what it stands for."

Most women are openly hostile even on their dating profiles to conservatives. A couple friends have found their golden tickets and have amazing women at their sides. Any suggestions on where to find conservative women that actually give a damn about morality and don’t act like supporting the second amendment makes you a child killer? I’ve had a few promising dates go down in flames because when asked I tell them I support the second amendment, voted for Trump, or supported Kavanaugh. I’d leave for Texas if I could but I need to be here for my family. I’m 34 and I really want to have a family someday. I know I could lie on dating profiles and have a girlfriend easier but it’s draining to keep your mouth shut about politics these days and I’ve done it too many times. I actually lost a girlfriend because I spoke my mind about Hillary during the election and listened to Ben Shapiro. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. "

If true, it seems to me that the legal way to proceed is to find out where each person came from then help them apply for asylum/refugee status in the first country that borders their own country.

Is there any other plan anyone is aware of? And what about the legal cases that will surely be filed by the ACLU and the liberal AGs?"

I believe something feeding this problem is that we have nothing to rally around as a country. So many things have become political I feel like we've lost our identity as a country and we need to come together. It's clear to me that those on the far left don't want to unite, they seek only to destroy in hopes of rebuilding the country as a fantasy utopia. However there are many more people who want to return to a more united America. As nice as it would be to ""own the libs"" into submission, that's not a viable or even desirable solution. 
  
Ben Shapiro often talks about the tearing of social fabric when things we once all shared, like football, become political. I think a possible way forward is to identify things that all Americans can and should unite under. These can be values, ideas, cultural events, holidays, pieces of media, art, whatever. I think we've gotten very good at what it means to be conservative and what it means to be progressive but we've lost what it means to be American. There will always be those who don't want to unite no matter what, but I think they're a small, yet loud, minority. So what is American culture and how can we use it to try to unite the country?  
  
Non-Americans feel free to contribute things that you think are American culture as well."

I describe myself as conservative, by the way.

Why do the left describe Trump as a fascist when the definition of a fascist does not fit Trump?

I'm baffled by it. I really am. The amount of history I've read, movies I've seen on fascism, Trump comes nowhere close. Do the people calling him a Nazi (I'm pretty sure if you asked theae same people if they support National Socialism, they would say yes without knowing what it is) or a fascist know what those terms truly mean or are they just using them as a way to make him seem terrible without knowing much about him or his policies."

The obvious fakeness of the bombs, the immediate shift of the media narrative to blame Trump and say that Republican enthusiasm in the midterms is starting to drop, the fact that every single one of the previous attempts to create drama/crisis out of nothing to harm the right has failed, etc. The bombs are fake, they were never meant to go off, there are too many red flags and obvious errors that can only point towards one conclusion: it was attempt to make it *look* like bombs were being sent to Leftists so that they can say ""see! see! the violent lunatics aren't just on our side!"" 

So the only conclusion anyone with a shred of reason can arrive at is thus: they are a false flag attempt by Leftists to make it seem like a Republican is sending bombs to Leftists. 

So the question is, how do we deal with his, and more importantly, how long until the Left ups the ante yet again and starts sending real bombs if and when these fakes ones aren't enough to give them the power they lust for?"

Because they receive billions of dollars in federal grant money, publicly-financed, tax-exempt organizations have significant incentives to support political candidates and parties that will keep these programs alive. These organizations need to be thoroughly audited and the current network of public/private immigrant advocacy and resettlement organizations needs to be completely overhauled. Resettling refugees should be a voluntary, genuinely charitable activity, removing all the perverse incentives government funding creates.*

[https://capitalresearch.org/article/resettling-refugees-part-1/](https://capitalresearch.org/article/resettling-refugees-part-1/)

Being entirely socialist in intention and design, the U.N. envisioned redistributing not only wealth, but also populations, across the globe. As stated in the document, “Human settlement policies can be powerful tools for the more equitable distribution of income and opportunities.”

 …point 1 in the preamble to the \[U.N. Settlement Policies and Strategies”\] land [section](http://habitat.igc.org/vancouver/vp-d.htm) makes clear the U.N. body’s utter contempt for property rights. Points 1 and 2 emphasize that land *must* be controlled by government, (emphases added):

1. *Land, because of its unique nature and the crucial role it plays in human settlements, cannot be treated as an ordinary asset, controlled by individuals and subject to the pressures and inefficiencies of the market.* ***Private land ownership is also a principal instrument of accumulation and concentration of wealth and therefore contributes to social injustice; if unchecked, it may become a major obstacle in the planning and implementation of development schemes****. Social justice, urban renewal and development, the provision of decent dwellings, and healthy conditions for the people can only be achieved if land is used in the interests of society as a whole*.

[https://capitalresearch.org/article/resettling-refugees-part-2/](https://capitalresearch.org/article/resettling-refugees-part-2/)

The Voluntary Agencies or VOLAGs are private, tax-exempt organizations that resettle refugees for the U.S. government. There are nine VOLAGs, six of which are nominally religious, and these organizations often promote their resettlement activity as a biblical mission. However, VOLAGs are strictly prohibited by regulation from any form of proselytization to refugees. In reality, they are simply government contractors paid handsomely for their services.

[https://capitalresearch.org/article/resettling-refugees-part-3/](https://capitalresearch.org/article/resettling-refugees-part-3/)

Together these nonprofits siphon millions of dollars from the federal government, spreading the gospel of immigration as they line their own pockets and perpetuate an agenda that advantages the Left as it dismisses justifiable concerns from communities strained by the needs of these newcomers.

This act is despicable and evil, however, in attempt to give some understanding as to why and how the political climate got this volatile and toxic, Ben spoke of how in American politics today everyone wants to assume malice. Everyone (the media in particular) gets satisfaction from assuming malice of others and both the left and right are guilty of this. For example the left are quick to assume malice of supporters of the second amendment and NRA members as hicks that don’t care about children being murdered in school shootings instead as seeing them as genuine individuals concerned for their individual rights to self defense. On the flip side when someone on the left says that they support socialized healthcare the right is quick to assume malice as well and see them as a freeloader that just wants control as opposed to seeing them as someone who genuinely wants better healthcare for all and is proposing a different means of achieving it. Him talking about this made me realize just how much of an issue this is. THIS is why our political climate in the U.S is so toxic. THIS is why everyone comes off as a judgmental assholes on Twitter. I think everyone, left and right could learn a thing or two from this. "

As someone on the centre-right, I felt a tinge of missed opportunity when the UK voted to leave the EU. As a traditional voice of free markets it did have a unique voice and role to play in the Union. Indeed, following the referendum result many in the Union referenced it was losing an invaluable voice in support of free markets and trade. The USA itself was concerned about losing such a consistent ally within the Union.

I was never pro the UK joining the Euro or Schengen Agreement fully, but hoped that a continuance and enhancement of a UK special status could be retained. Instead the anti-Brexit movement has been hijacked by the Liberal Left and the Right has been taken up by the UKIP/harder right leaving many moderate conservatives losing ground.

What’s your views on Brexit?"

Menendez is a corrupt slimeball!

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/indictment-of-sen-robert-menendez-and-salomon-melgen/1651/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/indictment-of-sen-robert-menendez-and-salomon-melgen/1651/)

Maybe even worse:

 

**FACT:** The FBI and President Obama’s Justice Department had specific, corroborated evidence to back up allegations that Senator Menendez had sex with underage girls in the Dominican Republic. Those women never recanted. It’s also important to note these are not the same women who recanted in affidavits released by Dr. Melgen’s cousin.

**FACT:** The FBI also discovered a “black book” listing Menendez 9 separate times alongside the names and phone numbers of multiple women in what an FBI agent testified looked to be a ledger of prostitution activity.

**FACT:** The pilot of Menendez’s friend, convicted felon Salomon Melgen, also testified he flew “young girls” who “look\[ed\] like escorts” on Melgen’s plane. In addition, the FBI confirmed that young women who received substantial sums of money from Dr. Melgen were at Casa De Campo at the same time as Menendez.

**FACT:** Confronted with the FBI’s corroborating evidence that placed Menendez in the same place at the same time the alleged sex with underage victims took place, Menendez lied. The Obama DOJ called his denials “demonstrably false.” Menendez and his legal team argued in federal court documents that these allegations, even if true would hardly be a crime.

I was reading a post by someone who got really upset that people don't believe Muslims are more oppressed than Christians. 

In my experience, Christians are constantly willing to denounce actions by the radical portion of their population like the KKK or Westboro Baptist Church. However, your average, everyday, peaceful Muslim is no where to be found when it comes time to denounce an abhorrent, violent attack by members of their own radical population.   
I'm interested in hearing why people think this is, if it is true.

I'm also interested in hearing how Muslims are more oppressed here in the US. As in, I want to see a law or policy that oppresses Muslims. I know many people have a prejudice against them but I want to see how they're actually oppressed. "

THE CARAVAN OF CRAP 
by bob lonsberry
 
        The Hondurans in the caravan, the 7,000 people walking north to America, where do they go to the bathroom?  And eat and sleep and store their clothes?  And how is it that after a week on the road they are clean and their hair and clothes are well kept?

        How is any of this possible?

        And why do these people, supposedly fleeing intolerable conditions in their homeland, carry little flags from their homeland and break into its national anthem when the TV cameras show up?  And speaking of which, for oppressed people, they all seem to be pretty well fed, well groomed and well dressed. Their hair is neat and newly cut, their clothes are clean and in good repair, and they are built like people who have had ample nutrition all their lives, being well developed and, many of them, overweight.

        And none of them look dirty or unkempt, like they had been sleeping on the ground for the last week.  There’s just nothing in any of this that makes sense.  Supposedly, these several thousand people spontaneously decided to leave Honduras, walking north in a group, hoping to trek the length of gang-plagued Mexico and present themselves as refugees and prospective Democrats at the American border.   Which, again, makes no sense whatsoever.

        And leaves a lot of big questions unanswered, and ignored by the press. Such as, who organized this? Who is paying for it? How have they covered 500 miles in a week?  Seriously. Any number of American “reporters” have walked beside a sympathetic walker and talked about how this particular woman and her children had trekked half a thousand miles over the last week or so.  That’s 71 miles a day.

  The best soldiers through history have been able to march 25 miles a day.  How have 7,000 people been fed and watered? And how have they gone to the bathroom? If the average person across the world produces about a pound of solid waste a day, that means that these folks are somehow disposing of more than three tons of feces each day.  That’s a heck of a lot of crap, even for a Central American roadway.

        Provisioning such an army of people – the equivalent of 10 combat battalions in most of the world’s military – is a large task. Transporting and distributing the food and water necessary to keep those people moving is a massive chore which the press says nothing about.  The entire enterprise, as a spontaneous ad hoc event, is implausible.

        As an orchestrated international attempt to influence an American election, it starts to make sense.  And ought to alarm us.  Unless it’s only Russians we don’t want screwing with our democracy.  Unfortunately, none of this has made the evening news. It’s almost as if the press, in whatever scheme is afoot, gladly accepts its role as propagandists to the American people.

        Every story is sympathetic, as if an attempt to enlist viewers and readers in this caravan and the politics it symbolizes.  And so the story is not about an orchestrated attempt to manipulate electoral opinion and violate the borders and laws of the United States, it is about compassion and Trump and xenophobia and racism. It is the October surprise, it is the Blue Wave.  And it is all nonsense.

        Because all of these people, if legitimate, have the ability to apply for American asylum in their own country – as do the residents of most nations of the world. We have consulates and embassies for a reason, and this is one of those reasons.

        We also have laws and an oath of office for a reason.  Laws, so that “we the people” through our elected representatives clearly and systematically govern our society. Law is the means by which the people express and exercise their sovereignty. Disobedience to law is disobedience to the will of the people, it is the subverting of their sovereignty and franchise.

        Breaking the law is denying you the vote. Your vote elects representatives – lets you pick the country’s direction – and the representatives write the law. If that law is ignored, your representation becomes meaningless.  You get screwed.  And the oath of office?

        Members of Congress – even Democrats – swear an oath to “bear true faith and allegiance” to the Constitution, which establishes our system of laws and specifically charges the Congress with making the rules of naturalization and immigration.  Who comes across the border and under what conditions they can stay is a constitutional responsibility of the Congress. That is to be determined by a congressional vote, not by a Honduran mob.

        Failure to insist on that – even for Democrats – is a violation of your congressman’s oath of office.  So there is not a Democrat or Republican response to this travelling army of invaders – there is only an American response.  And that is: Turn around and go home.

        Because the law of the United States does not allow a mass entry like this. The law does not declare the borders open.  If Democrats and progressives don’t like that, they can try to change the law. If America’s progressives want open borders and believe all the world’s people have a right to live in the United States – as they say they do – then they should adjust immigration law accordingly.

        But until then, if they are to keep their oaths of office, they must stand for the law and the border.  And they must tell their surrogates to turn around and go home.  Because this caravan is nothing more than a bunch of political s***(crap).

Conservative,2018-11-06,I’m an atheist conservative. I want to explain my viewpoints and see if there are any others like me.,44,9rv7z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9rv7z4/im_an_atheist_conservative_i_want_to_explain_my/,25,1540683926.0,"I’m a white man from Texas. I have grown up with southern values in a religious/spiritual house hold. I became an atheist because when I looked into all the arguments for god’s (or gods) existence I wasn’t convince there was one(or many) and simply don’t believe now. Although I did become Liberal for a while just off the bases all other atheist are and didn’t want to vote for a religious party, but now I pretty much said fuck that. I am very conservative to heart and I truly believe, now, that if you are an atheist you should be conservative.

Let’s start going through some of the issues. I’m pro-life. I believe that there is only one shot at life no one know if there is a before or after, all we know what is here and now and to take that way from someone I think is inhumane and wrong. Not to mention the majority of abortions are done by minorities, helping to keep them minorities, which is what i truly believe liberals want. 

I am pro gun. It seems logical to me that if a bad person has a gun, to stop him, a good person needs a gun. The idea that if we make guns harder to get things will get better is bullshit. These people have never taken a basic economics class in school. You learn that anytime the government makes something illegal a black market will open for that good, so people will still get guns and probably not the good law abiding ones. All that doesn’t is make good citizens not be able to Defend themselves. Also from a scientific perspective, we have always had a way to defend ourselves throughout our history as humans, this possibly being hundreds of thousands or a few million years of existence, and now all the sudden we just throw that out the window because people are so great and would never do us harm... fuck that.

I’m for the economy and businesses. I’m a business student so that explains this point. But serious if you taken any business classes and actually learned anything you would not like taxes and understand why lower taxes is always a good thing for both businesses and individuals. 

Now let’s talk about LGBT issues. First off, I just don’t think there particularly helpful. We been in existence for a long time and for most of our history we couldn’t afford to have only gay people, mainly for the survival of our species. So gay marriage and all that I don’t care about really. But the trans-people I think there is something wrong with them. I think it is a mental disorder. Once again we have been a around for a very long time and now to say fuck all that I want to be something else just doesn’t add up. Your telling me that you have a girl brain in a guy’s body, for fuck sake people. Not to mention I have seen some weird shit from these people like a trans-man is now a dog, like what? I honestly think people just need to embrace who they are as people, it is ok to be a man, it is ok to be a women. There are men that like feminine things and women that like masculine things, but you don’t have to change your gender or whatever to like things and be yourself. Even if people find certain things weird because you’re a guy or girl, who gives a fuck. Be ok with the way you were born. 

Lastly, I want to talk about this idea of liberals being the party for atheists simply because they are the “non-religious” group. First off I think is completely untrue. They have been supporting Islam a lot lately through everything I have seen. If there is something I disagree with more than christianity, it would have to be Islam. Like for fuck sake people, this groups actively believes in killing people like me simply because I disagree with them on religion. And you want to support a party that supports that idea. At least when I’m supporting the “Christian” party these are the people that even allow me to be atheist and not be forced to believe or killed for disagreeing with them. Also I feel I have to point this out (below)because many atheist try to disagree with this point and I don’t get it, it doesn’t validate the existence god. That is our country was founded and started by Christian ideas and beliefs. The idea that you should choose to believe or not is up to you is not something you see of other religions and I would argue the only reason why I can even be an atheist and not be killed for it is because the majority are Christian, most other religion aren’t this kind. And yes I realize it may have not always been like that in England and before, but what is now is what matters to this point. 

So, after all that I hope y’all can see why I think if you’re an atheist you should be conservative. Also, why we can be friends and not enemies. Share this with a friend that is an atheist and see if it helps change there mind on what party they want to vote for.

P.s. I’m bad at grammar. Please don’t attack me over that, attack my ideas.

October 19, 2018](https://deadlocked.com/2018/10/19/the-kavanaugh-connection/)

We have all heard the anger, watched the vitriol played out, experienced the bruising confirmation process, and seen the Senatorial votes decided in his favor, without realizing that Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment was a central link in the chain of the Great Conflict of the Ages!  What does the Voice of Prophecy for today have to say regarding the appointment of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court?  That story forms the feature article of the current edition of The King’s Journal, which was first written and published on July 10th, over 70 days before his confirmation to the bench of America’s highest Appellate Court.  This story is worth reading for “there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the”  children of men today, (Dan. 2: 28), as verily as He did in Daniel’s day, the truths of His word and of the things that are coming upon the earth, thereby preparing a people for His Kingdom.

The TRUMP Effect

Love him or hate him, Donald Trump will go down in history as one of America’s most consequential presidents, and when he wins a second term in 2020, the light will turn on in the minds of many, that “America is truly Great Again”–great enough to lead the world by force into a religio-economic stranglehold called “the Mark of the Beast” system.  Only a “GREAT” nation can muster the military and economic clout to mandate that even earth’s “great” must conform to its international decrees and policies:

“16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” Rev. 13: 16, 17.

Mr. Trump has already appointed two Supreme Court Justices, and he still has another 6 years left in office!  Six years?  Yes,  Donald Trump will be a two-term president, and he’s now closing the second of his eight-years in leading this “great” nation and the world!  It is likely that he will single-handedly appoint the most Supreme Court Justices to the High Court, more than any other President in the history of the United States (POTUS)....

All demonstrations or marches are wrong if they involve in any way property destruction.  Harassing anyone in a public place or at their home is wrong.  We would all be in favor of that and Trump would surely do it.  And unfortunately we know neither Obama or any other democratic leader would do it.

I just want to offer my two cents as a conservative Asian American on this issue. Harvard says they don't discriminate against Asians because we apparently have shit personalities(no joke) the New York Times revealed they use 200 factors on admission decisions and one of them was ""Personality Score"". Why they reject so many overqualified Asians is because they're all ""hard workers"" and ""want to be a doctor."" Apparently, that's what we're only capable of because all we do is memorize shit and are robots (sarcasm). But what about all the Black/Hispanics that get in with far lower SAT scores and grades? No one actually answers that and instead attacks me by calling me a racist for pointing out the data. Asians need to score 450 points higher than blacks for an equal chance. If you look at the recent incoming class it's 22% Asian and 15% Black. Statistically Asians and Blacks are at the opposite ends of the academic spectrum. High schools that are majority black are failures. Would you want to send your kid to a high school that's 90% black? Hell no, the education sucks and your kid is probably gonna get beat up and bullied relentlessly. Not being racist, statistically majority black high schools also tend to be the most violent. Now look at schools that are majority Asian, they tend to be among the best. So how the f is there only a 7% gap between Asians and Blacks at Harvard. At schools where there aren't race based admissions the gap is usually 5-7X the black student population. Example, look at NYC specialized High schools (Stuy, Brooklyn Tech) that are merit based only aka entrance exams (sadly going to shit because of socialist mayor). It's astonishing that Asians aren't atleast triple the black percentages. It's pretty clear a lot of the more deserving Asian students are being discriminated against in order to take in less qualified blacks/hispanics for the sake of diversity over merit. I'm supporting the Supreme Court and hope they win against Harvard. What is everyone's thoughts on this affirmative action case?

The  Arctic was supposed to be ice-free, hurricanes were going to be more  frequent and more deadly, and sea levels should be rising alarmingly.

Al Gore swore in his 2006 science fiction movie, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" that within a decade there would be **a ""true planetary emergency.""**

**""Unless  we act boldly and quickly to deal with the underlying causes of global  warming, our world will undergo a string of terrible catastrophes,""** said Gore in the movie's introduction.

The grand storyteller also predicted in 2011 that **""there will be no more snows""** on Mt. Kilimanjaro **""within the decade.""**

Four years earlier, the Guardian of Britain reported that the United  Nations was warning that we had **""as little as eight years left to avoid a  dangerous global average rise of 2C or more.""**  Three years and more than 1,000 days ago, then French Foreign Minister  Laurent Fabius — a  socialist, of course — advised us that **""we have 500 days to avoid  climate chaos.""**

We  could go on. But we have neither the space nor time to rack up all  the  missed global warming predictions. So we will merely point out that   instead of these disasters, we have the climate alarmist community  admitting that there has indeed been a pause in the warming and that its  models failed to predict it.

Yes, that's right. The alarmists are acknowledging in the abstract of a research paper that was published in [Nature Geoscience](https://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2973.html) that there have been **""differences in model and satellite tropospheric warming rates.""**

The study **""concluded  that Pruitt was wrong and many media outlets reported that conclusion.""  Will they be just as aggressive in reporting that Pruitt was right?**

Not a chance.

They  have been crying wolf for a long time. His former place of employment  was the center of the  first 'Climategate' scandal, in which hacked  emails showed that the  scientists were manipulating data that would  have undermined their global warming assertions,

# We've long known that at some point the confession had to be made.  The alarmists couldn't carry on the charade forever.

Government wants more power and will lie and scare you to achieve it.",13,9s6g38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9s6g38/18_examples_of_the_spectacularly_wrong/,4,1540787367.0," 

1. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated in 1970 that **“civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”**
2. **“We   are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this   nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,”** wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.
3. The   day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page   warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely   to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable  deterioration  and possible extinction.”
4. “Population   will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in   food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April   1970 issue of Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least   100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the   next ten years.”
5. **“Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,”**   wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…\[1975\]   some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present   level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable   proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate   food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”
6. Ehrlich   sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue  of  The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4   billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the   “Great Die-Off.”
7. **“It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,”** declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.
8. Peter   Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970,   “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: **by   1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990   to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By   the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will   exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now,   the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America,   and Australia, will be in famine.”**
9. In   January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and   theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade,   urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…**by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”**
10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, **it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”**
11. Barry   Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all  of  the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to  suffocate.
12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting **in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.”** Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.
13. Paul   Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other   chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life   expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that **Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years,**   and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy   would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According   to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8  years).
14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, **“By   the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude   oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil.** You’ll drive up to the pump and say, Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say,  
I am very sorry, there isn’t any.’”
15. Harrison   Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a   chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and **estimated   the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead,   zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.**
16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that **in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”**
17. **In   1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the   original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the   next 30 years or so,** it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”
18. Kenneth   Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been   chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. **“If   present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder   for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in   the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an   ice age.”**

Her gender doesn't really seem to change her character, which feels a little odd. She carries around a plucky diverse band consisting of a black man, Pakistani girl, and pathetic middle aged white man who really just wants someone to tell him what to think and do.

Latest episode: Giant spiders preying on humans. We can't *shoot* the spiders. That would be bad. It's inhumane to kill living things. Even when a spider is suffering and slowly dying, it's bad to shoot it.

The villain: He likes power. He wants to be a president. He fires people indiscriminately. He carries a gun and wants to use it to shoot things that are trying to kill him. His business is not environmentally friendly. He's truly a cartoon-worthy villain.

You might think the giant spiders would be the common antagonist in this episode, but really it's the meanie bully who doesn't like the nice liberal people. I might have to finally stop watching this show."

Are people really so quick to pointing fingers at Trump? That maniac was literally a Trump-hating Nazi.

>\*\*“\*\*Our Jewish community is not the only group you have targeted,” the group wrote. “You have also deliberately undermined the safety of people of color, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Yesterday’s massacre is not the first act of terror you incited against a minority group in our country.”

When has Trump said anything to incite violence in any of these communities, let alone the Jewish community?

I just wish that at some point, we could be more respectful during these times of nation tragedy. This just makes me sick."

Over the years (and especially since 2016) I have noticed that my peers and colleagues have gotten much more intense and vocal about their beliefs, which is now causing a bit of a career crisis for me, because I work in an environment where I feel totally isolated and fear speaking my opinion for fear of blacklisting or being ""outed"", despite every theater in town claiming to be a 'safe space'. I worry that I have wasted my 20's building a resume that is useless in other sectors and that now I am going to have to start over from scratch.

Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and look into alternate career options or stick it out in hopes that the political climate will cool down? Not that I foresee that happening any time soon, unfortunately. I truly love the work and find creative fulfillment in it, but the people can just be so insufferable. I've yet to meet anyone in my field who openly claims to be conservative, although I know that there must be at least a few, statistically speaking. I'd imagine that if they are out there they are also wary about vocalizing their views. "

I was only exposed to the left side through school and home, and really didn’t know what “conservative” was at all. All I knew is that my friends were all liberal and they severely demonized the right, so I figured I was liberal too. I eventually had a class on politics, and that’s when things started to turn a little bit. When learning about democrats and republicans I realized that none of my internal beliefs actually lined up with the liberal side, and I was really confused. I had a faint feeling about everything being off but I of course didn’t put much action into it and ignored my gut feeling. Couple years later as J got older I started becoming more interested in politics, I wanted to speak about how I felt, but I couldn’t because I didn’t know anything. I actually had no background for any of my statements and wanted to gather some in order to be relevant in giving an opinion. I did a lot of research in both sides through articles, videos, channels, etc. For some reason the majority of the pro-left content I viewed was irritating and none of it seemed reasonable, throwing me off because I figured the left side was the go-to. But when I viewed pro-right content it was much more different. People started making sense to me, and I was seeing things in a different light than I did before. It was kind of intense and while this sounds corny as hell, it was really a revelation for me. I’ve found something I can fit into and identify as, it’s actually pretty nice. Anyone else experience something similar? Sorry for the essay lmfao "

There were a myriad of reasons, but the main one was their politics. Every day at work I had to hear how awful Trump and his supporters are. Every day I had SJW politics shoved down my throat. Every day I’d wake up dreading putting on the globe and driving to work.

 It was a great opportunity, financially. It paid better than anywhere I’ve seen for someone without a college degree. But money isn’t everything. I felt like every time I got dressed in the morning with their company logo, I was selling a piece of my soul.

I was reported to HR for being a racist a few months ago by an employee for correcting her as she and the other “ladies” were discussing Trump. It was during the whole “Trump is separating kids from their parents at the border” fiasco that’s been going on since Clinton. I simply informed her that it was existing policy brought forth by a Democrat President.

The investigation yielded no results, obviously, however I was denied my request to transfer three times following this incident. Of the three times I applied, I only even got one interview. Keep in mind that per AT&T policy, managers requesting a transfer are to be given priority. Each time, they hired a female person of color. Now I have absolutely no problem with this if the candidate is as qualified or more qualified, however that was not the case.

To put it simply, I feel that due to people inferring my political leanings, I’ve been denied opportunities. Perhaps that’s the case, perhaps not. I’ve spoken with my family attorney and they believe I may have an EEO case. I have yet to decide whether to pursue this avenue. What I really would like to know, are there any conservative companies hiring? Do they even exist anymore? Or is everyone now completely bought into identity politics and leftist politics?

Any feedback, or criticism (I welcome it, not fear it) is appreciated."

Anyway, I am a Conservative Asian American that goes to a high school in NJ. I have been called racist and sexist many times for simply expressing a viewpoint. It seems that I cannot step foot into a conversation without offending someone. Also, in class when we have political discussions, any conversation is barred, and we spend time discussing the “racism and sexism” of conservatives. I’ve had to spend most of my time closeting my conservatism. When they say something wrong, I want to say something in response to that, however I fear that I will be shunned and silenced once I do so. Should I speak out in high school, or should I stay silent no matter what?"

Non-white early voting turnout may be up in Florida, but not at the same intensity as Republicans.  Although we still have a week to go for early voting.

>African-Americans so far account for about 11 percent of early and mail voters, and they make up nearly 14 percent of the electorate. Hispanics so far account for 12 percent of voters and they make up nearly 17 percent of Florida’s electorate. (The totals, from University of Florida political scientist Daniel Smith, do not include Palm Beach County.)

>Those turnout figures don’t entirely support the contention of Maurice Thompson, a sixth-grade teacher who also voted early with his son, Alexander, in tow at the African-American Research Center in Fort Lauderdale.

>“Everybody’s excited about this election,” Thompson said. “Even the people who don’t pay attention are paying attention.”

Conservative,2018-11-06,So... how was I able to slip through the cracks?,0,9sl67n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9sl67n/so_how_was_i_able_to_slip_through_the_cracks/,5,1540907205.0,"So I just got done watching a video with steven crowder, and he goes on  to talk about how generation Z is the most conservative generation yet,  being pro gun, pro free speech, how they weren't coddled and insulated  growing up and how he just has a lot of hope for that generation.  


And  while i wouldn't go so far as to say they are the most conservative  generation yet, I will agree that from my experience, generation zers  tend to be more reasonable, open minded and just generally easier to  talk to. I say this because i generally notice it all over the place, whenever i talk about something  controversial (Usually anonymously) it's usually the people in the mid  20's to early 30's that tend to be the most hostile. But the ones  between 13-18, i tend to find are the ones with the best heads on their  shoulders, or at the very least the ones who are open minded enough to  have an actual discussion. So from my personal experience, crowders claims do actually have some merit.  


So this begs the question...  how did I slip through the cracks? I'm easily in the millennial territory  and yet i don't act like the stereotypical entitled man-child of this  generation at all. I mean Yeah i was sheltered, but it was mostly for my  own safety, and apparently i was never all that interested in going out  much anyway. I was also kind of a late bloomer, i didn't get into gaming proper until i was 10, i didn't get my own computer until i was  15 or so and I've only recently started actually using social media  sites on a regular basis. Frankly If i could sum up my life in one  sentence it's ""Late to the party""  


So I basically have this very  weird mindset where i was born in the millennial generation but i think  like a generation z'er. I honestly regret heavily not being as social as  i could, but now i wonder, did i dodge a massive bullet being such an  introvert growing up?   "

Currently. 20 million Redditors are subscribed to the subreddit. Lurking in that sub is a vile disgusting expression of hate which is simmering with violence against the black communitt an Republicans .   


From the day of it's inception (created by \socialism as a prank to troll reddit\  it has been a breeding ground of hate for racists by racists.   


The Ultimate goal of r politics was to support the election candiate barack obama  as President. to frighten scare and intimidate the right. Though the sideline rules of the sub reject racism the proof is in the pudding. Any length of time lurking in that sub and you will discover it's anti-semetic and racist underbelly. Sadly. these comments and posts are not removed and the sub itself is riddled with calls for violence against both Republicans and black people - Further to this it makes use to racist posts which are disguised as something else. their use of the meme further adds to the idea that black people  and women and gays are not human while encouraging violence against them.   


Their defense of alleged alcoholic rapist beto orourke is yet another notch in their belt of venom against the vulnerable to attack victims of rape. and promote a rapist as some kind of moral paragon and man of the people shines a light on the kind of thinking that is rife in that sub.  


 as decent humans who stand up for whats right we on /td and other subs which defend those who are wrongfully attacked must call on /u  $pez to remove this subreddit and ban it entirely. We must put an end to a subreddit which propagates false news hate. violence against minorities hate against america. they constantly launch attacks against poor. Blue collar workwrs from middle america who are simply looking for a better life.   


If /u $pez will not take a stand against hate we need a new site admin who will. This most recent Republican office shooting has pushed things too far - it is well known that the far left wing terrorist was a regular on anti-Trump sites.  


Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

I believe we need to either abolish or rework the welfare system. Why would I think such a thing? Well, ever since it's implementation poverty has not gone down at all. In fact, poverty in the United States has stayed exactly the same ever since LBJ started his war on poverty. The truth is giving people free federal funds will discourage them from pushing to provide for themselves thus they will never left themselves out of poverty. The welfare system can also be easily exploited by ilegal immigrants with loopholes like ""Anchor Babies"". What I think we should do is rework or get rid of the current welfare system we have today and find a better solution rather than throwing money at it. So what do you think? Should we keep Welfare or not?"

This is something that I as a conservative do not agree with. I take advantage of early voting every election year. I find it to be very convenient and it allows me to vote on my schedule so I don’t have to ask off for work. Why is there pushback from the right? I don’t get it and I want to understand. 

I tend to agree with republicans on most voting issues like voter id, return to paper ballots, etc but this one escapes me. I’m open to changing my view on this if it is properly explained to me.

>“Senator Jacob Howard, the author of the citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment – he spoke – he told us what he meant. He defined who would fall within the ‘jurisdiction of the United States.’ Ready?

>“‘Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, [meaning the states – their jurisdiction] is, by virtue of natural law and national law, a citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens**, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United States. This has long been a great issue in the jurisprudence and legislation of this country.’"

Conservative,2018-11-06,"These ""right wing terrorism"" talking points are ridiculously misleading.",8,9t262d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9t262d/these_right_wing_terrorism_talking_points_are/,1,1541043918.0,"I hear this talking point from liberals all the time, especially since these MagaBomber and synagogue shooting stories broke. It's always some variation of the following two talking points:

>""Since September 12th, 2001, right wing terrorism has accounted for 73 percent of all extremist incidents in the United States.""

>""Since 1993, 85% of terror incidents in the United States have been caused by right wing groups.""

And they always link to either a study by the GAO or by the ADL. 

The problem is, **""racist white guy"" does not equate to ""right wing"" by default.** At least not in the sense of being fairly lumped in with American Right Wing politics. Furthermore, the incidents these reports cite are clearly not acts of extremism or terrorism anyway. 

For example, here's the GAO repot:

https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf

Just scroll down to page 30 to see their list of incidents. It's obvious what's going on. The overwhelming majority of these incidents are clearly just totally non-political gang violence. Here are some examples of their ""right wing incidents.""

> White supremacist murders Hispanic man in convenience store after argument

> Two white supremacists murdered a gay man as gang initiation rite

> White supremacist murdered his stepfather to gain “street cred”

> Prison gang white supremacists murdered another inmate for not objecting to having an African American cellmate

> White supremacist inmate killed his African American cellmate

I'm practically picking these at random. Anyone who looks at the incidents in this report can see that the majority of them are like these.

The thesis of this report basically says that there have been more than twice as many cases of ""right wing extremism"" than ""Islamic extremism"" since 9/11. They're not calculating this by death toll, for which Islamic extremism is still higher, but rather the number of incidents. Regardless, when someone hears that talking point, they imagine that right wing terrorism must be absolutely rampant in this country. Nevermind the fact that any actual far-right terrorist act would guaranteed be covered by every major news outlet in this country for at least two full days, probably a lot longer now that Trump is in office.  

But that's not what's going on. What's going on is that there are a lot of gangs in this country, and the vast majority of them are racially homogeneous, particularly those in prison. There are all-white gangs in this country, there are all-black gangs in this country, there are all-Latino gangs in this country. Am I to understand that when someone in an all-white gang murders a rival gang member in prison, that's ""right wing extremism,"" but when a member of the all-black or all-Latino gang murders rival gang member in prison, that's just murder? How does that make any sense? 

Wouldn't it make just as much (or as little) sense the other way around? If the logic they're using is that the white pride gang member is far more likely to vote Republican than Democrat, couldn't you just as well say that an inner city all-black gang member is far more likely to vote Democrat than Republican? African Americans in general vote Democrat 9 to 1, and I highly doubt that the Republican ten percent falls anywhere in line with the inner city gang member demographic. No one in their right mind would call some drive-by shooting in downtown Chicago ""left wing extremism,"" and rightfully so.

And the idea that there's somehow a major difference between the white gangs and the black or Latino gangs in terms of their motivation doesn't really hold water. They're all just street gangs. They're basically all driven by identity and they draw in people for basically the same reasons.

If it were some white nationalist shooting a Democrat candidate, bombing city hall, or killing somebody due to some clear political motivation, then there would be some logic in calling that a ""right wing extremist"" act. Same thing goes for a black nationalist. But nobody should consider some black nationalist killing their step-dad after an argument ""left wing extremism."" That's called ""domestic homicide.""

Likewise, if some racist black guy shoots a bunch of white people because he's racist, does that somehow get grouped in with left wing politics? If the guy had no political motivation for the crime, no motivation at all other than being racist, would we call that ""left-wing extremism?"" Of course not. We'd call that a racist guy shooting a bunch of people. 

And the ADL report is exactly the same. Here's their list of extremist incidents from 2017.

https://www.adl.org/resources/reports/murder-and-extremism-in-the-united-states-in-2017#the-incidents

Maybe I've miscounted, but I see exactly one actual right wing extremist act here, which is the Charlottesville murder. The rest are clearly and obviously gang-related or domestic homicides, they have nothing to do with politics at all, let alone the American right wing. 

This is just a nasty, manipulative way to lump in every racist asshole in history with conservative politics.

And look, I'm not claiming actual right wing terrorism doesn't exist. Obviously there was the Oklahoma City bombing, but that was one incident that happened 23 years ago. If we're looking at this accurately and not just twisting statistics to create some partisan talking point, you have to acknowledge that in today's political climate we're seeing at least as much politically related violence coming from the left. When you look at groups like AntiFa, that is actually politically motivated violence. That's not some guy shooting someone after an argument in front of a diner, or some guy killing people out of sheer racism, that is someone going to a political rally and attacking someone due to political motivations. The Republican office in Wyoming got burned down last month. A Republican candidate was stabbed a few weeks ago. Last year someone shot at Republican congressmen at a ballpark. And yet we hear non-stop about this ""epidemic of right wing terrorism."" I mean, just Google the words ""right wing terrorism"" and look at the results. "

* “But, in fact, anti-Semitism was already quietly on the rise. For several years now, expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment have made up the preponderance of hate crime complaints in the city.”

* “Contrary to what are surely the prevailing assumptions, anti-Semitic incidents have constituted half of all hate crimes in New York this year, according to the Police Department. To put that figure in context, there have been four times as many crimes motivated by bias against Jews — 142 in all — as there have against blacks. Hate crimes against Jews have outnumbered hate crimes targeted at transgender people by a factor of 20.”

* “In one of them, according to the police and prosecutors, a Muslim livery driver jumped out of a car and started beating up his victim, seemingly at random, yelling “Allah.””

* “If anti-Semitism bypasses consideration as a serious problem in New York, it is to some extent because it refuses to conform to an easy narrative with a single ideological enemy.”


In other words, anti-Semitism is a huge problem,  a significant chunk of it is coming from “ethnic tensions” (read: Muslims), and it’s not getting much attention because it doesn’t fit the leftist narrative about hate crimes coming from far-right groups."

So how come that if you are white, your opinion does not matter? And I know what some people are going to say, black people make up only 14% of the population, so they are being killed at a higher rate, and that is terrible, but that should not matter. Just because a group of people are suffering from a problem at a higher rate does not mean that that problem is specific to them only. This absurd idea that your opinion is less valid than another persons opinion based on your skin color is ridiculous. Police brutality is a crime that is faced by everyone, and to divide people by saying that they have not ""truly"" felt its effects based on the shade of your skin is stupid and dangerous."

For the record, I'm a 20 year-old army reservist who's a very staunch constitutional conservative, although I try to be as intellectually honest as possible in all arguments and try not to take sides without first educating myself on the background of what's going on. That being said, several things have become painfully obvious to me over time. Please note that this is my \*opinion\* and I'm more than open to debate, criticism, and corrections and will freely admit any mistakes I do make. I have a very open mind and you are all more than welcome to try to change me.

&#x200B;

**The culture war will continue to get worse until one side decides to be bigger.** 

As we continue to see, increasing incivility on the left is causing people to walk away from them in mass. As conservatives who hate the left, it is our job to bring them in - without criticizing them or their former side. We have to be the voice of reason, the bigger person. That means intellectual honesty; admit when your side is wrong, don't take viewpoints and stances on things when you don't know what you're talking about, stop trying to fight insane leftists head-on in r/politics and other subs where you're going to get overwhelmed by brigades of screaming mobs filled with leftist psychopaths that will do nothing but create insult-wars that only serve to degrade our credibility. And please, for the love of god, stop insulting everybody who disagrees with you. 

**Everybody short of a sociopath believes their views are morally correct.** 

This is the huge problem in our current political sphere and I've had enough of seeing both sides spew horrifying insults at the other. Haven't we been telling leftists for years that the only way to get through to moderates and conservatives is to talk to them like people and acknowledge validity in their views, no matter how much you disagree with them? Didn't we tell the left that their lack of ability to do this is precisely the reason they lost in epic fashion in 2016? You reap what you sow, and right now all I see is an inane hatred of the left that has spilled over into the way we treat people who have even moderately leftist views, and it's the primary reason that everybody is so strongly set in their political views. **Be the voice of reason.** Maturity is an important trait for people who are leaving the left, as many who have don't become republicans because they still view the republican party as a poor alternative. We must take responsibility for that, no matter how much brainwashing the MSM has done. 

**Don't engage with screaming lunatics.**

I will forever remember what Ben Shapiro said in the wake of the Charlottesville rally and riot. Speaking about antifa, he said that by rioting, they gave the alt-right credibility solely because the alt-right got to play the victim. When you attack people in a violent manner, or when you engage with a mob of people that will just overwhelm you, you give them the excuse to play the victim, and that's exactly how the left has managed to keep as many voters as it has. We, as a group, have to fight the left's ability to even attempt to play victim by not engaging in the first place. By being consistently civil, by refraining from insulting the left, we allow ourselves to appear as much more reasonable than we already do. That will gain us voters. 

The way I see things, and the way our country continues to divide itself further and further, I forsee two endings to our current state of politics: one side decides to be the voice of reason and/or their voters refuse to be married to mainstream politics and political figures, or this divide will end with a bloody modern day civil war where one politically motivated attack could spark a chain reaction that could crumble what little political sphere we have left. The modern-era left has no chance of playing peacemaker; it's up to us to save ourselves from ever increasing political bloodshed.

&#x200B;

I'm not leaving a tl;dr. If you ever respond to something like this just reading the tl;dr, you shouldn't be responding in the first place. "

Conservative,2018-11-06,"Both sides are angry, but the real enemy is the media. (Discussion about Jus Soli or Birthright citizenship and why it truly does need to go)",11,9th4kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9th4kz/both_sides_are_angry_but_the_real_enemy_is_the/,1,1541163269.0,"You know I see a lot of Republican Bashing on the main reddit and a lot of Democrat bashing here.  Before anyone gets excited I'm in support of getting rid of Jus Soli citizenship.  The problem is that the media has made it a divisive issue.  The left is presenting it like the ""Right just wants to kick out all the brown people"" and the right is pulling the ""There's an invasion coming our way"".  I'm a moderate myself but I was able to convince a far left feminist SJW that Jus Soli is a bad idea.  I simply presented the truth of the matter without sensationalizing it in a rational and logical way as such:

1. Jus Soli is sometimes bad for the people that get US Citizenship, what people don't realize is that if say a German couple is on holiday and they have a kid early while in the US, that child has citizenship and they may not even know.  Well little Hans grows up and makes a bunch of money.  Guess what?  He's a U.S. Citizen and liable for taxes even if he's never lived in the US and now needs to pay the IRS.  Now he's got to pay back taxes and pay like 4k to renounce his citizenship.  Don't even get me started on FATCA (FACTA?) makes banking overseas very difficult.

2. It drives up the cost of healthcare and burden on our already taxed education system, it gives incentive for illegal immigrants to drop anchor babies using false information.  I've seen healthcare data sets.  In some regions the SSN's are faked so often that they have determined that an E-mail address is better to identify someone than a GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID NUMBER.  The migrant farmers help the economy bit just doesn't fly anymore, most of that work is being done by machines.  Our education system (and consequently our test scores) take a hit when covering the cost of educating these children and Health insurance premiums rise when they use our healthcare for free. 

3.  Many people think that conservatives want to kick out people who are here on birthright citizenship.  Even if they did want to do that, they couldn't because of ex-post-facto laws.  Pure and simple.

If you want to win people over to your side or have a chance of compromise, you need to present if from the view of what they want.  Liberals would like to see people be as ""happy"" as possible (Albeit unrealistic most of the time)  Conservatives would like to be as realistic as possible (Sometimes without thinking about the human condition).  From where I'm sitting this is the reality of the situation and why it hurts everyone more than it helps.

I say all of this as the Son of an Immigrant and a Dual-national myself.  My family came here legally from the UK.

I do think we should make immigration easier, as each person coming in can help generate tax revenue and stimulate the economy.  We have plenty of room here and we are a nation of immigrants, but we need to have easier legal routes for people so they aren't given incentive to enter illegally.  We cannot just keep letting people live here who aren't paying taxes use our systems for free though."

Award shows are now stages to rant against Trump. That I usually wave off as privileged wealthy elites looking down on middle America like they always have. 

Buy one thing that has bothered me is authors I am interested in or enjoy ranting against all conservatives. I recently found out about an award winning series, every single book has been highly praised. When I check out reviews, I saw nothing substantial about why it was so good, just that it broke the mold and had to be read. Look into the author to find nothing but talk about racism, entire award speeches about racism. Then a rant about conservatives on election night telling all white men to fuck off just because they voted for the ""wrong person"". Needless to say I'm not buying that book. 

Then yesterday I find another author that is critically acclaimed. Start to read his blog and see rant after rant about Trump. He seems a bit better, usually separating his hate for Trump and the GOP from all conservatives. But he does go off on Trump's ""shithole"" comment saying anyone who doesn't agree that Trump is a racist, is also a racist. 

I don't want to be like the left, boycotting people for their beliefs. But I am also tired of this tired of supporting people that look down on me and hate me, people that call me racist just because I have different beliefs in government. 

Sorry for the long rant. Just wanted to get it off my chest. "

I've lurked here for a while, and started taking a more active role in this sub, I've found US politics extremely interesting, saddening quite recently but that's how it goes. For quite a while I've thought about migrating to the US, from Britain and with how Brexit seems to be going, it seems like the smart thing to do. However, I have no family in the U.S, at least none that are a close relation at all. I've looked into other ways, but the only thing that seems possible is via a Green Card, requiring outstanding abilities - that doesn't apply unfortunately. Note, I'm not strictly moving to get away, I admire the United States, and want to live in a free country, working a successful career.

Americans here, am I right in saying that it's very difficult to get in, and the ways I've said are the only ways that are even remotely feasible? If not, could I have some advice on how to go about it?

Kind regards,

CB"

**Toss-up LOSSES for Republicans**:

CA-10: It's a narrow Clinton/Obama district and two polls show the dem ahead narrowly. Plus it's Cali... it's lost.

CA-39: Clinton 9%, Romney 4%. Polling gives the Rep a chance here for sure, but I think it's a loss given the partisan balance and the state involved here. Plus no incumbency advantage here, it's an open seat.

CA-45: Another similar one with a R incumbent this time. Polling is worse, this seems more reliably a loss than the last one.

FL-26: Hispanic incumbent Rep vs white D.  Heavily Hispanic district looks lost based on polls.

FL-27: Same story as FL-26, polls don't look good.  Lost.

IA-3: Trump outperformed Obama here by 7%, plus incumbency advantage, but the incumbent is polling a bit too low to secure enough undecided votes.

IL-6: Clinton outperformed Romney by 15% here. Too many country club RINOs who love the Koch Bros to win imho, the latest poll has the incumbent at 44%, looks lost.

ME-2: Trump +10, Obama +9, swing district.  Polls all tied, but I fear this one is lost regardless.  No incumbent advantage.

MN-1:  Trump 15%, Obama 1%.  Open seat, dem up 2%.  Narrow loss due to the swingy nature of this district.

MI-11:  Trump 4%, Romney 5%, polls are close, but I believe it's a narrow loss.

NH-1:  Trump +2%, Obama +2%, but dem ahead in 3 polls.  Lost.

NY-19: Voted Trump 7%, obama 6%, but the polling is too weak for the R inc.

NV-3: No incumbent advantage, Trump only won by 1%, Obama won by 1%. Only poll shows Dem ahead by 2%, but the sample size is shit. This one looks lost to me regardless though. But it was a Dem seat to begin with, so no partisan net change if dems hold.

NV-4:  Clinton/obama district, open, poll +2 D, looks lost.



**Narrow toss-up WINS for Republicans**:

AK-AL:  Strong Trump/Romney district, only poll is statistically tied, advantage to R incumbent.

CA-25: Clinton narrowly won even though Romney won by 6.7%. Dem is an attractive blond woman.  At first I thought the dems would win this one, but the latest poll convinced me this is an R hold.

CA-48: Narrow Clinton win, big Romney win, but I'm giving this to the Reps based on incumbency advantage and the polling.

GA-6: Trump +1%, Romney +23%.  R incumbent ahead by 4%.  Narrowly held.

FL-15:  Trump 10%, Romney 6%, open district, tied polling.  Think we can win, but this one could easily be lost as well, WATCH it.

KS-2: Massive MAGA district Trump won by 18%, Romney won by 14%. It's open and the polls are close, but I just can't see them overcoming a partisan advantage of that magnitude. Plus it's Kansas, comon.

MI-8: Trump outperformed Romney and easily won by 6.7%. Polls are solid enough to count this a narrow win for the Rep incumbent.

NC-9: Trump/Romney won it both by 11.6%, but the polling isn't great for the incumbent. My analysis of early voting in this area says it's a win.  WATCH.

NJ-3: Trump +6, Obama +5. Polling is close, but not close enough to give this one to the Dems. Plus incumbent advantage.  I'd put a high degree of uncertainty on this one though.  This is one to watch very closely on election night.  Control of the chamber may hinge on this one.

MN-7:  Trump +30%, this democrat is in danger of losing his seat.  Pickup for R.

MT-AL:  Trump +20%, incumbent R has decent enough polls to hold.

NM-2: Trump +10, Romney +7. Given Trump over-performance and small Rep advantage in polling, I'd say we hold this open district.

NY-22: Same story as last one, but slightly stronger for Reps based on partisan advantage of 16%.

PA-1: Narrowly won by clinton/obama, polls are close, R inc at 48.5% but it's close, still think it's a narrow victory.  However this one could easily be lost as well.  WATCH IT CLOSELY.

PA-10:  Trump 9, Romney 7.  R inc narrowly ahead.  Hold, but need to watch it.

Pa-16:  Trump 20%, Romney 5%.  R Inc should win this.

TX-7: Clinton won this one narrowly, but Romney carried it by a whopping 22%. That means the partisan advantage is 21% R. These people obviously find Trump distasteful, but they'll probably re-elect their incumbent R. Poll is +3% for Rep at 48%.

TX-32: Similar story here, weak for Trump, but super strong for Romney. R incumbent narrowly ahead in the only poll at 48%. I have no idea what's wrong with my fellow Texans here.  If dems are having a great night this one will be lost, but I don't think so.

UT-4: Trump +6.7, Romney +37. Polls are tied, but I seriously doubt the Dems can overcome the partisan disadvantage.

VA-5:  Trump 11, Romney 7.  Open, but only one poll and it's statistically tied.  WATCH on election night!  I'm afraid here, but the partisan advantage will be hard to overcome.

VA-7: Trump won by 6.5, Romney 10.5. Slightly cucky here, Rep incumbent with 2% lead. I see a narrow hold here.

WA-8: This one seems to defy the trend more than any I've seen. Narrowly won by Clinton and Obama, but the Rep incumbent is ahead by 10% in the latest poll. Average of last two polls shows 5.5% lead. However newer data is desperately needed. I won't be surprised if this one is lost, but as of now I can't give to to the dems quite yet.

Liberal Conservatism - Adopts Social Liberal stances on economy (Markets, welfare...) but is, again, moderately Conservative Socially 

&#x200B;

Am I correct? 

&#x200B;

(Also, Im asking for a UNIVERSAL, definition of those ideologies, not ""American"" one and ""European"" one, because I dont believe ideologies should have completely different definitions based on their geographical location)

&#x200B;

Thanks!"

 The Senate seems fairly safe for Republicans, even though the exact pickup is uncertain, but the house is going to be tough. It's certainly possible to defend it, especially if suburban Republicans turn out, but the most important demographic, the one which will most likely decide the house, is moderate Republicans and independents. 

President Trump, for his part, is campaigning around the country and substantially increasing his focus on Immigration, and that caravan in particular. This would seem like a good strategy, given it helped thrust him to victory in 2016, but if you pay attention to voters interests it doesn't seem so; voters who are the most concerned about immigration are already Trump voters who will overwhelmingly support the  candidates he endorsed.

 The most crucial voter block, in the house as mentioned, are White suburban moderates who approve of Trump on the economy but are uneasy with his social policies, and they are the voters Donald is most likely to alienate by doubling down on the caravan. The mainstream media is already portraying him as causing violence with his words, (Which is unfair to put on him, but that's for another time) and instead of combating that narrative by toning it down, he's continuing to focus mostly on the caravan. 

It seems like he has nothing to gain from this, given only the most controversial parts of his rallies are even covered by the media, and much to lose. Overall I think this is not the best strategy for the midterms on the bottom of the 9th, but I'm open to conversation about it."

Support Bob Hugin and defeat corrupt slimeball Bob Menendez!

[http://www.themenendezfiles.com/](http://www.themenendezfiles.com/)

&#x200B;

Some facts about Bob Menendez:

 

**FACT:** The FBI and President Obama’s Justice Department had specific, corroborated evidence to back up allegations that Senator Menendez had sex with underage girls in the Dominican Republic. Those women never recanted. It’s also important to note these are not the same women who recanted in affidavits released by Dr. Melgen’s cousin.

**FACT:** The FBI also discovered a “black book” listing Menendez 9 separate times alongside the names and phone numbers of multiple women in what an FBI agent testified looked to be a ledger of prostitution activity.

**FACT:** The pilot of Menendez’s friend, convicted felon Salomon Melgen, also testified he flew “young girls” who “look\[ed\] like escorts” on Melgen’s plane. In addition, the FBI confirmed that young women who received substantial sums of money from Dr. Melgen were at Casa De Campo at the same time as Menendez.

**FACT:** Confronted with the FBI’s corroborating evidence that placed Menendez in the same place at the same time the alleged sex with underage victims took place, Menendez lied. The Obama DOJ called his denials “demonstrably false.” Menendez and his legal team argued in federal court documents that these allegations, even if true would hardly be a crime.

I have an employee who has worked her way up to a managerial position. She’s mostly a good employee, and my customers really like her. She’s what I call a “politically disconnected Democrat” meaning she sees what she sees about Trump on Twitter and that informs her entire opinion of him. She knows I’m a very conservative person on nearly every issue and that while I take issue with what trump says sometimes, I have zero issue with anything he’s done so far. We occasionally talk politics, but the minute I sense she feels uncomfortable because she is having to confront the cognitive dissonance that comes with being a progressive, I change the subject. She doesn’t involve herself in local issues at all, but told me that she voted for obama in 2012 and Clinton in 2016. She wasn’t planning on voting in this medterm, for reasons unknown to me.

I know she bought her first house a few months ago and I asked her “hey, did you make sure to turn in your ballot?”, thinking it was likely she hadn’t updated her voter registration and hadn’t received her mail ballot as a result. She paused, looked at me side-eyed then asked me “why would you want me to vote?”

I said “because your vote is your voice. It would be a shame for you to not use it.” That’s all I said, then I walked away to complete some actual work.

Fast forward to today, she came up to me and slowly said “... hey Trumpstwitterintern, I voted.” 

“Great! Congrats on your first midterm vote- it counts about 4x as much as a presidential election due to the lower turnout”

::nervous laugh:: “yeah.... for Governor I actually voted for Walker Stapleton the Republican.”

Me: “.... wow, can I ask why? I know you said you voted for Hillary and obama.” I’m totally taken aback at this point.

Her (paraphrasing) “yeah I did. But you encouraging me to use my voice even knowing I was a Democrat showed me that you actually care about the system and the people it’s supposed to help. I looked into the candidates deeper to educate my self and my vote, and found out that Stapleton actually represents my views very well.”

You guys! I’m so excited! I know we talk about it in theory but it’s TRUE; we are winning the war of ideas. I don’t tell this story to pat myself on the back, but to tell you all how a small act of good faith can build trust with someone who would have had problems trusting people like you in the past (in this case, conservatives). Be kind! Be good! Be who you set out to be! People will notice, and it only contrasts more and more with the other side."

I was surprised when I received my ballot two weeks ago and didn't recognize several of the ballot measures for my state of Oregon. After some research I figured I'd write out a quick guide for my fellow Oregonians as well as my recommendation for how Conservatives should vote on these measures. 

**Measure 102**

This measure if passed will allow the local governments to issue bonds to private entities to build affordable housing. Currently there is a state constitutional prohibition on loaning to non-governmental entities under any circumstances. 

*Recommended Vote* - **NO** It's is none of the government's business to subsidize housing in a state where housing prices are already jumping higher and low income housing in the state is already ramshackle and run down. 

**Measure 103**

If passed it would amend the constitution to prevent taxes being placed on groceries and food in general from distributors and producers. If not passed it would leave open the possibility of such taxes. 

*Recommendation*: **YES**. 

Oregon is famous for not having a sales tax and this amendment would prevent any kind of backdoor sales tax. If not passed this allows the possibility of taxing distributors/producers who would then pass the extra cost on to us, the consumer. Our income tax is already one of the top in the nation and sales taxes would make the burden of life on those of us in the middle class harder. 

**Measure 104**

If passed, this measure would require a 3/5 (60%) vote in the legislature to raise any fees. Currently the constitution requires this for taxes but not fees. If not passed, a simple majority would be required to raise fees. 

*Recommendation*: **YES**

Oregon is a mix-and-match state as Portland, Salem and Eugene are deep blue but the rest of the state is red. As a result, our state senate is a good mix with a simple majority leaning democrat. Our taxes haven't gone up, but the state senate has found ways around this by raising fees such as our DEQ testing and registration renewal fees for our vehicles. This would prevent a simple majority from making our lives harder because the simple leftist majority wants to collect more of our money. 

**Measure 105**

If passed will repeal the sanctuary state law. 

*Recommendaation*: **YES**

This goes without saying. Oregon was the progenitor of the sanctuary state law and it should repeal it immediately. As seen in Portland the hard leftists do not like border enforcement or immigration enforcement at all so we need to make it harder for them to harbor those that do not wish to follow our laws. 

**Measure 106**

If passed will repeal state funded abortions. 

*Recommendation*: **YES**

Regardless of whether you're pro-life or pro-choice we should be able to agree that the government has no business funding things that are morally grey at best and that violate a lot of people's religious liberty on how their money is spent. It's our tax dollars funding something that is morally and religiously reprehensible and takes away freedom of speech/religion wholesale.

This candidate (Mckiernan) is running on nothing of substance and she is just playing up being a woman. This article is 300 words long, and she manages to mention being a woman twice, including in the first sentence! It is the most cliche article I have ever read – literally no specific policies are mentioned. [http://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester\_star/commentary-open-forum-proven-leader-mckiernan-unapologetic-in-declaring-not/article\_f2dad2dd-af10-5111-87b4-cfc3bcf5ccc6.html](http://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/commentary-open-forum-proven-leader-mckiernan-unapologetic-in-declaring-not/article_f2dad2dd-af10-5111-87b4-cfc3bcf5ccc6.html)

If this wasn't dumb enough, she is running against ANOTHER WOMAN, so either way a woman will win. Shockingly she forgot to mention that... Maybe she can't make a case for herself on policy, or maybe she doesn't care. Either way, I think it is in all of our interests to stop people like this from being elected.

Here is her Republican opponent Debera Taylor's Facebook page. Give her a like or just thank her for running an issues based campaign!: [https://www.facebook.com/Deberataylorfor4thward/](https://www.facebook.com/Deberataylorfor4thward/)

Here is why Debera Taylor is running (policy, not IDpol). You can also donate on the website or volunteer if you live in the area: [https://deberataylorforwinchester.com/](https://deberataylorforwinchester.com/) Please support Debera Taylor (I don't work for her or anything, I just think it's important).

It would be a huge mistake to only care about the Presidency. Don't let SJWs infiltrate local politics. People launch from local, to state, to national politics. Don't let this ideology get a foothold in elected office. McKiernan also posted on Facebook about supporting BLM.

The government has no right to intervene in my personal life - and - I should be able to create legal contracts with any other consenting adult - including civil partnership/marriage (no, church's shouldn't be forced to marry me...).

The Republican party needs to actually embrace its small government mantra. Gays like myself tend to be pretty hard working, and have - on average - higher incomes than our straight counterparts. Dare I say most of us are not out to dismantle the foundations of America, impose our views, etc. We just don't want fundamentalists to make laws that discriminate against us, and treat us differently (see consenting adult line above). 

If the Republican Party supported sensible public health programs (HIV/AIDS prevention, safe sex initiatives, etc) - which are moderate by anybody's estimation, except strip-mall pastors - then we'd have a better chance making inroads into 'my' community. Gays, on average, have pretty high incomes - most of us hate paying taxes (doesn't everyone) - and want to see our money used intelligently.

I'm hopeful that in the next decade, the Republican Party will soften its stance towards gays. We're an untapped voting pool that has been on the democratic plantation too long. As radical Islam/sharia on American shores becomes more of an issue - we'll need a new party to call home.

**Julio Gonzalez, M.D., J.D.**

On October 30, 2018, President Trump voiced his intent to end birthright citizenship through an executive order. To those on the left, his comment sounded outlandish and devoid of any attachment to reality.  To others, the comment was an expression of wishful thinking, or worse yet, a hollow political stunt.  

Indeed, the President's only defense of his claim when pressed was, ""Now, they're saying that I can.""  

Well, who is they?  And to whom are they saying it?

Immediately, reporters and politicians alike responded with claims of the plan's unconstitutionality.  On the same day that President Trump spoke of the idea, Adam Liptak of the New York Times [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/birthright-citizenship-executive-order-trump.html)that President Trump's claim was at odds with the legal consensus.  Liptak reached back to the testimony of then Head Counsel for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, Walter Dellinger, before Congress in 1995 who [said](https://www.justice.gov/file/20136/download), ""Because the rule of citizenship acquired by birth within the United States is the law of the Constitution, it cannot be changed through legislation, but only by amending the Constitution.""  Similarly, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-says-you-cannot-end-birthright-citizenship-with-an-executive-order/)in an interview with ""Larry Glover Live"" on WVLK, ""You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.""

But like so many other things in law, innovative approaches and ideas that are in fact allowable become so only because the idea is viewed under the scrutiny of a different prism.  This case, I believe, is no exception.  

**Presidential Powers.**

The powers of the President of the United States, and indeed the entirety of the executive branch, are defined in Article II of the Constitution of the United States.  The Framers made it perfectly clear in Article II, Section 3, that the President of the United States "". . . shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. . ."" 

The mandate goes straight to the most elemental check upon the President, and indeed, the whole executive branch.  The President cannot create any new laws.  All the President has the power to do is make sure that statute *passed by Congress,*or authorities given to him by the Constitution, are carried out in a manner consistent with the statutes enacted by Congress and with the language contained within the Constitution.  

As a matter of fact, the question of whether the President has the authority to write new laws has already been reviewed by the Supreme Court and struck down.  In *Clinton v. City of New York*U.S. (1998), the Court [reviewed](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1997/97-1374)the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 giving the President the power to veto certain items in the budget if he so desired.  So strict was the interpretation of the prohibition upon the President to in any way alter a law presented to him or her by Congress, that even the mere alteration through a line-item veto was interpreted as giving the President the authority to amend the statute he was altering.  The power of amendment, the Court said, rested only with Congress, a signature feature of the Separation of Powers doctrine that colored the Constitution.  Any intrusion through amendment or line item veto by the executive was expressly prohibited. 

So clearly, the President, and all departments of the executive branch are bound to the charter of faithfully executing the laws of the United States and may not alter them.  

But interpreting the laws of the United States is an altogether different matter.  Both the executive branch and the President are continuously tasked with interpreting the laws passed by Congress.  Essentially, the President lacks any authority to do anything that either the Congress or the Constitution does not allow him to do.  But if Congress grants the executive the authority to carry out a particular task, then it is fundamental to the successful execution of that task that the President and the departments answerable to him interpret Congress's mandate.  

In certain areas, Congress has made perfectly clear what it is that they wish for the President or agencies to do. Elsewhere, Congress has not been specific, either because it purposely wished to give the authority of interpretation or policy design to the executive, or because it lacked the political will to pass the law inclusive of specific definitions or directions. 

**The Fourteenth Amendment’s Language Regarding Birthright Citizenship.**

In 1866, the country was reeling from the devastating effects of the Civil War.  The South lay in ruins.  The Democrat establishment inculcated in the southern states, although militarily defeated, was doing everything it could to maintain its old class and economic system. Although slavery had been outlawed and former slaves emancipated, southern Democrats were busy building roadblocks to the success of former slaves and African Americans in general. 

Yes, slavery was no longer an option, but southern Democrats still had the *Dred Scott*decision at their disposal. In the most offensive Supreme Court ruling in American history, the Court in *Dred Scott*held that black Americans were not citizens of the United States, and that even if a state had afforded the person citizenship, such an act did not concurrently grant American, or federal citizenship.  In other words, merely because an individual of African descent was a citizen of a certain state, he or she still would not be considered an American citizen.  The post-war Southern States, under Democrat hands, aimed to capitalize on that still governing opinion.

The Reconstructionist Congress immediately took to rectify that situation and repeal the *Dred Scott* opinion.  It would do this through a Constitutional Amendment.  Congress had already outlawed slavery by passing and ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  Now, it was hard at work at correcting this latest affront to former slaves by fashioning an amendment that would accomplish five things: 

1) clarify that citizenship of the United States supersedes state citizenship;

2) define who is a citizen of the United States; 

3) guarantee equal protection under the law to all citizens;

4) guarantee due process rights to all citizens; and

5) guarantee the same privileges and immunities to all citizens.  

The result of their efforts was the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, a rather voluminous addition addressing all the aforementioned issues.  Regarding who is recognized as a citizen of the United States, the Fourteenth Amendment [states](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv), ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.""  

Notice that the Fourteenth Amendment does *not*state that all persons born in the United States are citizens, but rather, those who are born in the United States and who are ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof.""

So, what does ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" mean?

For that, we have information from debates and Supreme Court cases.  In the debates leading to the passage of the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, some senators agreed that the phrase essentially [meant](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33079.pdf)""subject*to full and complete*jurisdiction of the United States.""  Consequently, the phrase was included to make sure that certain persons born in the United States would not be considered citizens. These included American Indians, foreign invaders, and foreign dignitaries, such that, for example, if a foreign dignitary were to find herself pregnant in the United States and gave birth to a baby on American soil, that child was not considered to be a citizen of the United States.  

The question of the citizenship of a baby who was born on American soil to someone who found herself in the United States illegally was never contemplated.  Clearly, upon interpreting the language and the intent of the addition of the clause, it is clear that such an individual would not be subject to the full and complete jurisdiction of the United States and would likely not have been intended to be a citizen of the United States according to the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment.  

For the contrary interpretation we would have to go to the few cases decided by the Supreme Court where the Court dealt with the language of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, but whose circumstances were not identical to the questions posited by President Trump. 

*United States v. Wong Kim Ark*, U.S. (1898) was a case dealing with the citizenship of a child born in San Francisco to Chinese, non-citizen immigrants.  In that case, the Court ruled that the child was indeed a citizen of the United States. The stickler here is that the baby's parents, although non-citizens, had come to the United States and were residing within the United States, *legally*. 

Contrarily, the Court held in *Elk v. Wilkins,* U.S. (1884) that the children of American Indians were not automatically considered citizens of the United States because, even though they were born on U.S. soil, the parents, by virtue of belonging to an American Indian tribe had not subjected themselves to the complete jurisdiction of the United States.  

There are cases dealing with government benefits where courts, even the Supreme Court, have decided that the children of illegal immigrants born on American soil are eligible for benefits because they are citizens of the United States, but in such cases the courts began their analyses under the assumption that these children were citizens.  More to the point, the Court has never decided whether birthright citizenship is absolute and immutable under the Constitution, or whether it is subject to regulatory oversight.  In other words, the question of whether Congress or the executive can interpret the Fourteenth Amendment in such a manner that clarifies the meaning of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" and thereby limit certain classes of individuals from being citizens has never been entertained by the Court. 

**Congress Opens The Door To The President's Executive Order.**

Whether the President has the authority to make a policy interpretation directly from the language in the Constitution of the United States is an interesting discussion, but our analysis does not have to reach that question because in point of fact, Congress passed a statute codifying the citizenship clause within the Fourteenth Amendment.  

The Immigration and Nationality Act passed by Congress in 1952 actually codifies the citizenship and naturalization provision of the Fourteenth Amendment in 8 U.S.C. §1401(a). It [reads](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401), ""The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth: (a) a person born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof; . . . ""  However, in it Congress did *not*define the meaning of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof.""  

Consequently, so long as Congress fails to define the meaning of the clause, it falls upon the executive or the President to do so.  Therein lies the invitation by Congress for the President to interpret eligibility for birthright citizenship born to a person illegally in the United States. Admittedly, the judiciary may also interpret that phrase, but it can only do so in a case or controversy with standing where the actual question of the meaning of the phrase is at play. Additionally, even if the judiciary interprets the meaning of the *statutory* language, a definition put forth by the executive or Congress will supersede the judiciary's definition.  

However, if the judiciary were to interpret the meaning of the phrase *as it is used in the Constitution*then only a constitutional amendment could overturn the decision, which represents yet another example of why our nation is well served by the passage of a [legislative override provision](http://www.thefederalistpages.com/articles/a-new-supreme-court-session-a-new-threat-to-our-liberties)to a Supreme Court decision.

**The Merits Of Ending Birthright Citizenship.**

Having established that the President has the authority to end birthright citizenship by simply defining the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof,"" should he?

I begin with the question of whether it should be done at all.  There are a number of arguments in favor of ending birthright citizenship. Perhaps the most compelling of these is that birthright citizenship serves as an incentive for illegal immigration. Unquestionably, many women would risk life or limb to have their children born in the United States just so that the baby would be a citizen of the United States.  The practice has many deleterious effects, not the least of which is increasing the number of American citizens with dual citizenship. Additionally, once the child is a citizen, it becomes much more difficult for authorities to deport the parents.  And finally, of course, the child born under these circumstances becomes the first link in the chain of migration that will naturally include his or her parents.

There are also real costs to illegal immigration.  Jon Feere, a policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies [pointed out](https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Feere-Testimony.pdf)during his congressional hearing in 2015 that about 375,000 children are born to illegal immigrants in the United States each year, or one in 10 births.  Additionally, 71% of illegal alien households with children make use of welfare benefits. The aggregate costs of these programs run into the billions of dollars each year.  And bear in mind that in the developed world, only the United States and Canada honor birthright citizenships.  

Who has the authority under the Constitution to end birthright citizenship?  Clearly, from our analysis, both Congress and the President have the authority to end birthright citizenship without amending the Constitution. 

So who should do it?

Congress, of course!  Congress is where such a robust discussion should rightfully take place.  But if Congress does not or cannot, then the responsibility falls upon the President. 

If President Trump were to end birthright citizenship through an executive order, there is a strong likelihood that the Supreme Court will overrule him regardless of how the executive order is fashioned.  But if it does so based on a claim that the President lacks the authority to define a vague and previously undefined statutory clause, the Court will be glaringly guilty of two things.  First, it would be guilty of randomly and capriciously denying the President the authority to do something that is fundamental to his duties of faithfully executing the laws of the United States.  And second, the Supreme Court will be making a decision not on the inherent authorities granted to each branch of government as it should, but merely on its disdain towards the policy enacted, clearly a policy consideration outside of its own purview. 

The President is correct in asserting his authority to interpret a nebulous congressional statute, even if the result is the end of birthright citizenship.  At the very least, doing so will force Congress to have the debate it should have had decades ago.

One of the issues on the ballot was voter id. In considering this important amendment, I tried to do research from both sides of the issue. On the pro voter id side, the loudest arguments were that voting is a sacred rite and should not be corrupted. The best arguments against brought up the extremely low rates of voter fraud, and how voter id would disenfranchise poor and minority voters disproportionately.

The argument that voter id would be used to disenfranchise voters who more traditionally vote Democrat should not be dismissed. I think safeguarding the integrity of our elections is very important but I also believe that disenfranchising informed voters is extremely morally abhorrent especially if it is done with the intention of raising up one political party.  Fair warning, I have not done the appropriate research on this argument, I am more interested in exploring the argument talking about the necessity of voter id. 

This argument struck me as potentially weak.  Every time I hear it i can't help but think, ""how could we know that? If there were such thing as a perfect crime, would we know it? 

I also think back to my time voting in the 2016 and 2018 elections. In my less than 30 years alive, it was the easiest government action I've ever undertaken (DMV, licensing, purchasing vehicles, going to court, applying for permits, titling vehicles, navigating rules and regulations, etc.) Should voting be easier than buying a gun? Should voting be easier than buying liquor or beer? How about than picking up a package from the post office?

How can we make a rational decision about an issue as important as this without knowing what we don't know? How can we know if voter fraud is rampant and or not?

Are there things to do to mitigate this issue? Is the two years until the next election enough time for those voters who would be disenfranchised to figure out a way to get proper id?"

**by**

**Julio Gonzalez, M.D., J.D.**

Once again, we find ourselves at a midterm election, and once again, the nation is at an impasse.  Essentially we are confronted with a referendum on two alternative and incompatible visions for the future of our nation.

On the one hand, we have the followers of Donald Trump.  Take away what you feel about Donald Trump himself, his tweets, his comments. . . his insults.  The fact is that certain people placed him in power, and those people believe in certain things.  If you support Donald Trump or the candidates in his camp, you are supporting the aspirations and dreams of this group of Americans.

These are people who believe that the United States is the greatest country in the world.  They believe this status carries with it certain responsibilities.  Those include an affirmative leadership role globally.

They also believe the United States is truly exceptional, not because of a shared ethnicity since the country certainly does not have that, but because of a certain set of circumstances that made this country an exception to all others.  They believe it is the human spirit that drives greatness, freedom, and success.  They believe that the more government gets the hell out of the people's lives, the better off the people are, and the better off the government and the nation is.

The great flag bearers of this philosophy are people like, Mark Levin, John Bolton, Rush Limbaugh, and Ben Shapiro.

On the other, we have the followers of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  Once again, remove from the analysis whatever feelings you may have towards Sanders or Clinton.  Instead, think of the things the people who put them in positions of authority believe. These folks are not the Democrats of old.  They are not the people who, like John F. Kennedy, asked not what their country could do for them, but what they could do for their country.  These people are totally different.

They don't believe that there are problems plaguing the nation.  Rather, they believe the country *is* the problem.  They believe the United States is the great promoter of injustice.  This is because they America is a flawed state; from its inception!

They believe that the United States is the greatest fomenter of evil in the world today.  They believe that so many of the world's injustices; poverty, famine, disease, and even the future decline in the health of the planet itself is to a great extent the result of the presence and actions of the United States.  They believe that because the United States has achieved a certain amount of stability and wealth, it must now give most of it up to the rest of the world.

The people in this camp believe it is appropriate to suspend due process because of the many injustices the United States has itself perpetrated in the past.

They believe in socialism, wealth distribution, and in the inherent evil of their opponents.  They believe that each and every one of you is responsible for the health of all those around you, and you should pay for it.

They believe that every majority group is inherently hateful, or at least unjust, towards every minority.  For this reason, they claim others as being racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobes at will.

This group's flag bearers are Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Joaquin Castro, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Mazie Hirono, and George Soros.

And there you have it; the two directions being offered to the American public.

Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen such a stark dichotomy between the two groups hoping to lead our country, and today, each group is asking you to help it take the nation in the direction it believes is better for the nation and the world.  Each is trying to convince you that theirs is the better way.

The question *you* need to answer is which vision do *you* believe is better?  Your response is fundamentally important to our nation's future.

Am officially a conservative!

So, I've been lurking in r/conservative for quite a while now, though I only began to participate in the conversation recently. I have voted Democrat until this election. For the first time ever, I decided to vote all R. Here's my story. It's a long one, but I think it's appropriate to tell it here. I never told it on the #walkaway because it's on Facebook, and I'm a private person.

&#x200B;

My family arrived here many years ago, when I was a young teen, as legal immigrants. My parents are educated middle-class people and we came with my father's job. My father made sure to start us on a path to getting a green card and eventually citizenship. My parents worked hard, saved up bit by bit, and after 8 years were able to get a down payment for a house. We all got good education and one of my siblings is going to be a surgeon. 

&#x200B;

My very first vote was for Al Gore in 2000. And man, that was a mess. In retrospect, it may have been the time when the craziness in politics started. I voted D dutifully every election since then... that is, every 4 years. I had no real interest in politics and absolutely no idea that such things as midterms exist. In 2008, I of course voted for Obama. I was happy for the black community when he won. I always had a lot of sympathy for them and for Native Americans. 

Now, I am white but not ""white."" You know, mixed Middle Eastern/South European kind of ""white"" that's not ""WASPY"" white. I am clearly a foreign girl; and I'm also Jewish. And, with maybe one exception, any bigotry I experienced was all antisemitism. And it almost always, with a couple of exceptions, came from Muslims. It was not usually directed at me in particular, it was just in the environment in general, under the guise of anti-Israel sentiments. And over the years I began to realize that most of these people were supported by the Democrats.

&#x200B;

My first red flags about democrats, however, were not the growing antisemitism from the left, although this was the primary reason why I moved to the right. They always pretended the hostility was Israel-related, and until a few years ago I still believed it. It was when I read things from left-wing people which I felt to be wrong. Like those who were busy calling for justice cor perpetrators of crimes while seeming to pretend the victims don't exist. It helped that I don't see anything wrong with being a clean-cut person, i.e. conservative in your habit or beliefs. I am conservative in my habits as well. While I thought that a some Republican POLITICIANS were nasty people, I did not extend that to the VOTERS. At least, while I believed that some of them were not nice people, I didn't think it was everyone, and that is true for both sides.

&#x200B;

Then 2016 came. That was the first time I became truly interested in a political race. I was rooting (and voted) for Bernie Sanders. I didn't agree with him on everything (free college is a stupid idea and will fix nothing) but what happened in 2008 was alarming and I did not want politicians who would allow a few people (banks, Wall Street) to play with everyone else's financial fate. I read a lot about politics. It was when I was first exposed to how much suspicion of corruption surrounded the Clintons. I was NOT going to vote for her. With Trump I only heard the echoes of the media hysteria. His unwillingness to condemn David Duke and so on. That his father was a nazi sympathizer, or with the KKK? I dunno where this one is from but I never bothered to look. All I know is that no neo-nazi supporter would allow his beloved, precious daughter to marry a Jewish man, no matter the money involved. It's a matter of RACE to them. So called bullshit on that. I wrote in Sanders under president but voted all D for the rest.

&#x200B;

During election night I couldn't believe my eyes. I found it... how shall I put it? I found it FUNNY since I never believed Trump or most of his voters (except a few neo-nazis who seemed to buy the media narrative that he liked them) were evil bigots. Several of my co-workers were very, very upset (I lived in a very liberal area.) They were all ""abortion is GONE NOW! It's the END OF THE WORLD!"" Or something like it. I was all, ""Nothing bad is going to happen. He's not as bad as the media made him out to be."" 

&#x200B;

But this made me seek out more information. I used to look at r/politics. You know how it was very pro-Sanders and anti-Clinton before Clinton won the primary. After she won it became useless to me, so I tried to look elsewhere. I can't recall how I stumbled on r/conservative. I guess I just figured I'll look into what you guys were saying about all this, and also teach myself a bit more about conservative viewpoints.

&#x200B;

And then... ohhh, the HYSTERIA started. The more virulent it became, the more disgusted I became. I never liked the MSM to begin with-- bunch of empty talking heads, I knew this since I turned 12-- and now they were just... well. I don't have to explain. I dislike hysteria, paranoia and other wild talk that has no clear basis, which it usually does not. It generates instability, and instability can be dangerous. I moved away from the democrats simply as a reaction. I could not support people who appear to try to generate unrest for, as far as I could tell, no discernible reason. And basing this on assuming that half of the county are bigots. Not my experience is all I have to say.

&#x200B;

The straws that broke the camel's back and made me vote straight R were:

1- D's embrace of the likes of Linda Sarsour and Keith Ellison, and

2- The Kavanaugh hearings.

I don't think I have to explain either.

&#x200B;

I now call myself a moderate because I see myself as being in the center on many issues. That is, I can see the argument on both sides and would like us all to work on practical solutions. 

&#x200B;

That said, the democrats had gone too far. The discourse have become positively nasty. They need a harsh lesson. So I want them to lose, and lose BADLY. Like Matt Groening said of middle schoolers:

&#x200B;

""By isolating us from elementary school kids, they stop us from tormenting them. And by isolating us from high school kids, they stop us from getting the beating we so richly deserve.""

&#x200B;

Democrats are those middle schoolers who richly deserve a good beating. We'll know tomorrow.

Best of luck.

So its a rainy day in Northern Virginia. I took my mom to vote at the local middle school. I had voted earlier and there were volunteers from both sides handing out sample ballots. My mom walked past the Republican volunteer and was looking for a sample ballot. It turns out a moment before that another woman who was impersonating an election official at told the Republican volunteer that the sample ballots she had were the wrong color (green) and took almost all away from the worker.  The woman who was impersonating said the volunteer could not hand out any more sample ballots and that she was going to call and report the volunteer to election officials.

My mom went inside and checked with an official inside who said he had never heard of that. The woman who took the ballots hears my mom asking about the sample ballot colors and comes over to my mom. She starts to speak with mom and pulls out her phone to prove the Republican volunteer was in the wrong. She looked up the statues and she was actually in the wrong. Virginia statutes say the color green is absolutely fine for sample ballots.  The colors yellow and white are not permitted. She then walks away from my mom and does not return the stolen sample ballots. 

We have contacted both House and Senate campaigns and the county GOP.

Hi everyone,

I registered to vote a while back in my previous county. Recently, my wife and I unexpectedly had to move for her job which is a few hours away from the county im registered in (but still in PA). Since it was unexpected and things have been so hectic, I forgot to request an absentee ballot. I want to vote today but there is no way I can drive to the other side of the state to do so. Do I have any options or am I out of luck?"

In North Carolina, any person in the world can look up your voter registration with nothing more than your name, and get back your voting precinct location and your full name. No other information is required. Now Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky all require more than just your name to look up a voter's registration info.

&#x200B;

So at this point, what stops me from taking my coworker's name and address and going to vote as them? Sadly, nothing but the deterrent of prosecution. There are no checks and balances; there's no verification. The only way this would be found out is if my coworker decided to check their own voting history and see that they had a record for voting when they did not actually vote themselves, and then report it. If you're not voting, what's the likelihood that you're checking your own voting history for fraud? Pretty slim.

&#x200B;

\--

&#x200B;

This becomes an even bigger concern when bots crawl the NC voter reg website and then run analytics on the likelihood of someone voting, and if the odds are high that they won't, a malicious entity has enough information to cast hundreds if not thousands of fraudulent votes in our state. There's no remedy to this threat; this vulnerability, in our voting system without Voter ID."

We have seen economic growth, the decrease of the national debt for the first time in 16 years, and more personal freedoms being granted to the public.

But because the left won the culture war decades ago. They control media, social media, celebrities, and the minds of millions. It feels great to finally have a voice but I feel as though that voice won’t last. I know there will be dark days ahead as the left is now becoming more active than they were before and our freedoms are going to be stripped away, little by little. When the left seizes power again, they will do as they have always done and force the population to think their way.

History will not be kind to Trump. But that’s why it’s important to remember, because nobody else will."

I'm hoping that we hit 218+ in the House, but even if we don't, we all believe in ourselves much more than we do what the political class does in Washington.

i had to explicitly ask this question, and found I made a mistake, and was given what appears to be accurate information: for the ballot I was given to be valid and not subject to challenge, you must vote for ""one and only one of"" candidates in certain sections, but only dems are running. Anyone who avoids voting for the Democrat and doesn't bother to do the write-in candidate and mark it, their ballot can be challenged in (rare but posible) tight other race, or (I'm less clear on this)  preemptively discarded by a review.

So, democrats can just vote their line and all get counted, republicans have to write in whomever, and maybe some of them get don't get counted when it matters, even if they correctly voted in that instance, the entire ballot goes due to 'ambiguity'. Hell, I wrote in myself up against that rando Kennedy NPC. (No, you're thinking of a different one,this blockheads is only elected because people incorrectly think he's related to the Family, but is not at all.)

There are a number of school board positions that have no opposition, and no political affiliation noted. One assumes all Dem except the token socially liberal libertarian posing as a Republicans. For all of those, the instructions are different: you are explicitly told you do not have to vote, it reads ""no more than one"". So,skip those all you want, or write some random in. It doesn't matter, it's already rigged.

So, at least this is why conservatives should never let a Democrat or unknown run unopposed ever again, even if people won't win this race, maybe another race would be affected.

Milford, MA

(Sorry for typos. I'm using an unfamiliar pad.

P.s. It should be noted the MA Republican party is largely controlled by and organizations are subverted by, the left (some of whom are useful idiots 'centrists' (but, really, unthinking liberals with, maybe, a slight tinge of libertarianism - slightly smaller but no less powerful government - but are social liberals , - basically, if you 're a closet homosexual  who doesn't think Social Security is being handled right, but you secretly support gun control, they make you a Republican nominee and give you money. Except for a few individuals who do stand up (and get basically no support) but thereafter generally succumb to either blackmail and direct attacks on their business and families, and years of attacks (seemingly out of noehere) to one's reputation. The pattern has repeated itself too many times for it to not be part of the basic playbook."

One thing I learned from this midterm cycle, is that polls still hold some weight. I was interested to see if this was, in fact, the case after 2016. I predicted yesterday that we would lose the House, but keep the Senate, and the polls suggested this as well.

This shows a couple of things to me; the 2016 cycle was people finally being fed up with liberal concepts and ideas enough to get out and vote. I was worried that this was a one time fix, but alas as we can see the conservative voters continued to show support. Not in every scenario mind you, but enough to stay with the natural track of things.

At the end of the day, we held the seats in the places that matter most, and continue to have control in the more critical Senate.

I look forward to a wonderfully bright future for my family, and everyone else as we continue to make progress towards making America great again."

Conservative,2018-11-06,I'm Really Proud of how Conservatives are Handling Tonight's Losses when Compared with the Left's Reaction to 2016,785,9uzfbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9uzfbp/im_really_proud_of_how_conservatives_are_handling/,269,1541626241.0,"Compare the reactions on /r/Conservative, /r/The_Donald, etc. with those of /r/politics, /r/hillaryclinton, etc. in 2016.  It's night and day.  I honestly expected to wake up this morning to hysteria and hypocrisy from our side, but instead I'm seeing a lot of reactions that look to the bright side (i.e. the fact we *gained* in the Senate) and some sober acknowledgement of the losses in the House.

What this shows, I think, are two things.  First, we can see that the so-called blue wave was anything but.  Last night was the best outcome for which we could have realistically hoped, and in some ways it actually went better than we expected.  Second, it is, to me, apparent just how different conservatives are in relative loss than are leftists.  Yes, we lost, but we're not asking for our mothers' tendies, capital-letter raging on Twitter, or rioting with obscene hats in Washington, D.C.  That takes class and maturity.

I'm sure there are other posts getting into the data behind the election and what all of that means for the next two years.  I just think this is a very important aspect to looking at our party compared with the other.  After last night, and seeing how we are taking it, I'm even prouder to be a conservative and a Republican. "

Even if one dislikes greyhound racing, the heavy handed implementation is going to cause a large amount of short term pain.  As a matter of economics, greyhound racing was increasingly unpopular and was probably on the way out.  Florida had fairly effective regulation of the industry prior to this.  

This ban means that as many as 8000 animals are going to need homes, some as nearly as next month.  There was no provision made to fund adoption efforts: they only have to be taken to shelters, where many (probably most) will be euthanized.

This was an amendment pushed by an out of state group, who are in no way going to help clean up the mess they created.

On a personal note: if you live in Florida, and may be looking for a dog, please consider adopting a greyhound.  They are wonderful animals, and really, now, are in desperate need of homes.  Money helps, but it won't buy homes for these animals."

Will Republicans be more pro-ACA to resist a single-payer system, or will they continue to embrace the “more privatized, the better” mentality?

At this rate, I cannot realistically see any parts of the ACA going away unless it is making room for something more socialist in nature, and it will be years before that ever happens.  The only exceptions would be repealing the mandate, which I think would eventually make the system non-viable; and allowing purchase across state lines, which you would think would have happened already.

EDIT: Overlooked that the mandate is already on its way out, and that comes with its own set of costs and benefits."

So here is the text from him and then my response which I hope you will appreciate!


Random CNN lover, quoted my previous comment   a couple of times 

I'm not sure what any of this has to do with ""fair play"".  When we say ""fair play"" we are speaking of a fair playing field.  Things like making all votes count, getting all people out to vote no matter who they vote for, allowing everyone in the country to have a voice,  You know when a state has a 60/40 split in who the people vote for but representation in that state is 90/10 because the GOP gerrymandered it that way.

But I will bite on your laughable cherry picked examples.

>So you think how they treated kavanaugh was fair?

The Democratic party treated Kav much much much much much better than the GOP treated Hillary.  The difference, Hillary held herself composed during the investigations and multiple hearings. Kav was never properly investigated, and if you think the FBI investigation was good enough I would like you to imagine if your daughter was raped and the investigators were not allowed to talk to the accused or the victim or anyone that didn't want the victim to have a get out of jail free card.  Now tell me again how that was a real investigation. Oh, and we weren't able to see the results.

Speaking of supreme court justices, lets talk about Gorsuch.  That pick was supposed to happen under the Obama administration but because the GOP are my way or the highway they wouldn't even give anyone he picked an interview.  And then when Gorsuch came along, they changed the rules to get him in the office. Yep, sure, that was fair.

>You think Maxine Waters calling on violence against Trump cabinet members is fair play? 

Again, this is not what is meant by fair play.  But I see you like to change what actually happened here.  She called for people to confront and harass members of his staff because their voices are being ignored.  This is not violence as you say it is. Unless you think yelling at politicians is violent.

>You think articles labeling all Republicans as racist is fair play? 

Again, this is not what is considered fair play.  I get the feeling you don't know what fair play means.  But anyway, no Dems do not label all Repubs racists. That's just stupid to think that.  However, the GOP has a racist at it's head. Has a person that will not denounce racists, or even nazi's for that matter.  ""good people on both sides"". We do call out that the GOP seems to be ok with the party not doing anything about it's racist members and even praising them.  Hell, your party head is a self declared nationalist. That's not something to be proud of.

>You think shutting down any conversation about illegal immigration is fair play? 

No one shuts down conversations.  But the GOP is my way or the highway on this subject.  So why bother having one? 

>You think parading stormy Daniels around but ignoring Juanita broaaddrick is fair play?

Well, last I checked there are big differences between the two.  Broaddrick filed and then recanted an affidavit saying there was no assault.  Daniels never claimed rape and just talked about an affair and payoff that is well documented.  I mean, the two cases are nothing alike.

Anyway, thanks for the laugh.  Have a nice day. Try not to move goalposts so much

My response

Stating that illegal aliens shouldn't be able to vote is not voter suppression. They aren't voters. 

Gerrymandering has been happening for over 100 years and both sides are guilty of it. To claim otherwise is ignorant. 

With kavanaugh there was a 414 page document outlining the investigation into kavanaugh can be found here https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/senate-judiciary-committee-releases-summary-of-investigation-from-supreme-court-confirmation

45 people were interviewed and 25 written statement taken. 

Bonus points: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/10/25/chuck-grassley-refers-michael-avenatti-and-julie-swetnick-for-investigation.html

Avenatti and Swetnick being investigated for criminal accusations

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/3/another-kavanaugh-accuser-admits-fabricating-rape-/

2 accusers have admitted to fabricating their stories. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/opinion/midterms-election-vote.html

An article calling all Republicans racists from the article ""Republicans bore witness just like the rest of us to Trump’s hatred, racism, division, corruption and mendacity, but instead of rejecting him, they embraced him. They became his flunkies and minions, his accomplices and his defenders. There is now no daylight separating the Republicans in Congress from the man who occupies the presidency"" 

Fun fact not all Republicans are racist, not all Democrats are racist. Some from both parties are. But it's a gross overreaction to label all of one or the other side racist. 

Maxine Waters direct quote ""If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”. You push back on them and say they are not welcome here anymore. If you tell them to leave and they don't? That's where the violence starts. 

>No one shuts down conversations. But the GOP is my way or the highway on this subject. So why bother having one?

You are admitting to not being open to conversation. That's exactly what I'm talking about. There are plenty of conversations to be had about illegal immigration that can't be had when the only response is name calling. 

You should probably read things beyond what cnn and MSNBC tell you. They leave a lot out"

Main thing I wanted to ask is whether there are major issues that you think both sides of the political spectrum can resolve. Yes, there will always be differences in resolving said issues, but I want to know whether the people of this subreddit believe that there are issues that will get largely bipartisan support in government, especially with the now split Congress. 

I don't want to incite any anger or whatnot, and if the mods want to remove this post, so be it. But if not, I simply want to know the thoughts of the right since I live in a largely Democrat area."

He has a unique talent for dragging people down to his level and then driving them insane. Now that Nancy Pelosi is the speaker he has a constant target. If he can coerce her into feeding her most radical of urges then he should be able to keep his presidency and we might even take back the house. It worked on Rubio, Jeb!, and most recently Elizabeth Warren. None of these people are dumb, they're professional politicians, but he got underneath there skin so much so that they all self destructed in one way or another. If he can do the same to Pelosi she'll probably take the party down with her. This has little to no chance of blowing back onto him. People will just right it off as Trump being Trump.

**Julio Gonzalez, M.D., J.D.**

Americans must continue to bite its nails for some time before they know whether Florida will add another Senator to the Republican caucus.  

On Tuesday, most outlets were reporting either that Governor Rick Scott had defeated Bill Nelson, or that he led his opponent by about 37,000 votes.  As of this writing, however, the Florida Division of Election tallies the votes in the race for the United States Senate at 4,091,417 for Governor Rick Scott and 4,074,073 for Bill Nelson, a 17,344 vote lead for Scott.  But not all the votes have been counted.  

First, the unofficial results do not become certified until November 10, and voting machine recounts are due on November 15. If there are any discrepancies, or if the margin is less than 0.25%, then manual recounts in those districts would be required.  The next day, or November 16, the military mail-in ballots and the overseas ballots postmarked on Election Day or prior are counted.  And finally, on November 20, the state would certify the official results the winner barring a court injunction.  

Significantly, still absent from these tallies are the Palm Beach and Broward county vote-by-mail numbers, each of which is a Democrat stronghold.  In Broward County, for example, Nelson leads with 69% of the vote and in Palm Beach County, he has a 58% advantage.  In Broward County alone, there are about 30,111 votes that have not been counted. At a clip of 69% of the votes in favor of Nelson, it would result in 20,777 votes in his favor, still not enough to bring him over the top because of the 9,334 votes that would be gained by Scott keeping him in the lead by 5,901 votes.  The Federalist Pages was unable to verify how many votes were still missing in Palm Beach County.  

There are also provisional votes to be counted; 989 in Miami where Nelson has a 60% margin translating to 386 votes for Scott and 603 for Nelson.  In Hillsborough, where Nelson has a 54% lead, there are 760 votes outstanding giving 410 votes to Nelson and 340 to Scott.  In Polk, Scott has a 57% lead with 497 votes left to be counted bringing 285 votes to Scott and 211 to Nelson.  In Pasco, Scott has a 57% lead with 180 votes remaining meaning 103 more votes for Scott and 77 more for Nelson.  In Brevard, there are 285 votes remaining, and Scott carries 57% of the vote earning him 162 more votes to Nelson's 123.  And finally, in Orange County, where Nelson has a 62% advantage, there are 401 votes remaining, giving him 264 more votes to 137.

Tallying it all up Nelson earns 4,096,538 votes to Scott's 4,098,731.  

Of course, to these numbers, we would have to add the Palm Beach County numbers.  But also remaining is the great equalizer, the military mail-in vote, of approximately 22,000 members who ought to break strongly in favor of Scott.

Taking all these factors into consideration, The Federalist Pages predicts Rick Scott will ultimately retain his lead by a margin of less than 0.25% of the vote and will be Florida's next Senator.

There have been 68 deaths related to mass shootings in 2018.  That means you are more like to be crushed by falling furniture than a mass shooting.  

The 307 number includes mostly gang violence also, and if you look at the numbers provided by even Washington Post, if you count just public mass shootings (4+ deaths, not including gang violence) there have been 158 since 1966.

The media is pushing an anti gun narrative heavily while greatly misrepresenting the real, nitty gritty numbers!

68 mass shooting deaths, >12,000 homicides, and >22,000 suicides so far this year."

This is just an utterly ridiculous joke. Florida...well it's super tight. But Broward is taking days to report its numbers. And Arizona only counted 75% of all votes on election night. That's such BS joke. Even now, it's just 83% counted. It's the worst state by a mile in America in that regard. 

Why can't results just be tabulated and announced on election night? This has to be done in the future. Imagine a Presidential election where Trump appears to be winning FL and AZ (and these are the marginal states that got him to over 270 on election night). All of a sudden two days later, one flips and the other heads to a manual recount. There will be fking riots. It's scary! "

Ryan was conceived in rape, but his biological mother chose life and gave the beautiful gift of adoption.
He was adopted at 6 weeks of age and grew up in a loving, multi-racial Christian family of 15.

From keynotes at renown locations like Harvard, Princeton, Columbia Law School, University of Notre Dame, Ireland's Trinity College, March for Life DC, March for Life UK, Capitol Hill briefings, and hundreds more events here and abroad, Ryan is passionate about helping to build a culture that values Life in all of its stages.

You can read more about Ryan's biography [here](http://www.theradiancefoundation.org/ryan/).
Ryan also has a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/RadianceFoundation) which features a variety of videos presenting the facts on Planned Parenthood, and the importance of the right to life at all stages of development.

The sidebar quote, [best viewed on old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/Conservative/) comes from the article: [A More Genderless, Hopeless, Meaningless Society](http://www.theradiancefoundation.org/a-more-genderless-hopeless-meaningless-society/)"

Immediately after, a host (Max Kellerman) having this angry face painted on said 


>*""something needs to be done. yesterday. this isn't political, we need to do something. this happens every week. do something""* 


Obviously talking about gun control and speaking as though it is common knowledge that everyone wants it, or at least that his position is morally superior and the correct one and should be broadcasted to everyone since he is right...


One phrase I continue to hear is ""something needs to happen"" but more importantly ""its happening every few weeks now."" This implies these ""mass shootings"" are on the rise. - which anti-gun avocates such as ESPN will declare to the public any time they can push for gun control.


---


I'm 21, up until college (when I didn't follow news) I heard about 3 shootings my whole live. Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and Aurora. Now I can list off handfuls in just 2 years, Vegas, Parkland, Bernadino, Orlando, Pitt, yesterday, etc.


So the perception is that they are ""on the rise."" But why? Obviously its not guns. There have be increasingly more restrictions on guns since the assault weapons ban. 


Or is this just misrepresentative? For example, did these things really happen every week in the 70s, but no one knew because there was no internet and social media, there was no CNN/MSNBC/ABC that wanted to push gun control ever second, there was not ESPN/MTV/Late-Night that declared their stances as ""non political and common knowledge that something needs to be done""?

I'm a conservative independent, and I've managed campaigns for both Republicans and Democrats over the years. I try not to get emotionally invested in elections and politicians, but I love the numbers and strategy side of the whole process. After seeing the results of the midterms, I hear pundits talking about how it was a split win, but I disagree. 

I think the Republicans had the biggest win, and it wasn't the Senate or the Governorships. If you ask someone ""What's going to happen in 2020, 100% of people will say the presidential election. While true, it's not the only thing that is happening in 2020. In 2020, we will have the census and redistricting. Why is this important? It's important because the [Republicans just took/retained control of the legislature in all of the major swing states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/partisan-composition.aspx). This includes Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Now, many states require the redistricting to be done by a bi/nonpartisan committee, but it still needs to be approved by the state legislature. From a strategic point of view, this is a huge advantage in our system going forward until 2030. Most of the major policy in a presidential term gets done in the first two years anyway, and this administration is no different. 

The Senate is important to smooth out appointments. Governorships are important to provide the political machinery for presidential campaigns. Out of the House, Senate, Governorships, and state legislatures, the House is the least important strategically moving forward for the Republicans, and they have control of everything else. While I understand the reason for the tone of a split win this midterm election, the Republicans empirically came out on top.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not endorsing gerrymandering. If anything, there is an advantage to being able to prevent gerrymandering from the opposing party."

America was never supposed to have Jews, we should not be allies with Israel, European decent only should be American.

Why cant the left/ liberal recognize that those schools of thoughts are not actually a part of conservative beliefs and they are just the alt right.

What can we do to distance ourselves from these people?

Edit: rephrased question to be more accurate.

Conservative,2018-11-06,Conservative Humanism.,5,9vour8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9vour8/conservative_humanism/,0,1541830423.0,"I certainly understand the Christian foundations of Conservationism, however, a portion of conservatives are Humanist... an ideology that should be one of the **MOST** conservative doctrines in modernity and yet has been hijacked by the Left. Let me explain: Humanism (in its current form) is terrible, objectively awful, it totally fails in expression, the grandeur and imperatives of the human state. One only needs to look at the contemporary symbol of Humanism to understand the congenital meekness infecting this ideology. The core of Humanism has always been the primacy of our species. Consider this, ""Human Primacy"", for a moment; what are it's most essential and obvious implications? Of note, certain cultures protect the primacy of humans better than others, indeed, certain cultures are objectively better ways of human operation as evidenced by technology, law, GDP, etc.. In this way, Humanism SHOULD be the sword upon which cultural relativism is slain and yet the infirm modern Humanists are not themselves above reproach, but are themselves too cowardly to deliver it.

Another fine example is the Lefts romance with weakness manifest in victim-hood and body positivity. The (largely) self inflicted conditions of physical excess and narrative oppression, short-sell and undermine humans in favor of narrative and sloth. A true Humanist strives for physical robustness as to waste not of the inherited gifts forged over eons of human struggle. A true Humanist does not bathe in that which holds them back, but dons that which might take them forwards.

Our bizarre political context has allowed Humanism to remain in the feeble hands of those who fail to express the true implications of Human Primacy. Such is their negligence that even holding the moral absolute of Human Primacy, they fail to dismiss cultural relativism, they fail to banish post-modernist despair; and even in the face of profound meaning and purpose, they find none.

To the religious conservative, although we disagree on the foundations of our political leanings, we share so much of them all the same.

Thank you for reading.

I have started to post on Twitter with #conservativehumanism & #humanprimacy. Join me if you feel so inclined. In addition, I have started to construct a doctrine that more completely outlines what Humanism should be:

If we look on issues voters care about, Republicans win on Economy and Immigration. The one major issue they lose on is health care. In many of the electoral losses the Republicans have endured, health care was the biggest issue. When it was not health care, the Republicans did well. It is clear we are losing on the issue and no longer have the chance to repeal Obamacare.

I then propose that we concede on health care. I know that sounds like BS and a defeatist attitude, but it is the only major issue that Republicans are losing votes over. A lot of people are effected by health care and unfortunately more government intervention is the majority expectation now. If we can get rid of the health care issue, I believe the republican party will get rid of its weakest electoral issue and appear more viable to many more people. I think we can maintain relevance in suburbs this way and regain congress completely. We need to make the economy and immigration the biggest issue, and the only way to do that is concede on health care.

I voted straight R in 2018 and am very conservative, I just want the conservatives to win 2020 easily."

Julio Gonzalez, M.D., J.D.

Four days following the end of general elections, the process of vote tabulation in Florida appears to be irreparably corrupted due primarily to the misfeasance displayed by two rogue Florida counties, Palm Beach and Broward.  

Each county continued to demonstrate significant election aberrancies long after the election had been called.  Both Broward and Palm Beach failed to meet the 7:30 Tuesday deadline for reporting early and mail-in election tabulations.  These ballots, according to Florida law, had to have been tabulated before Election Day so they could be disclosed 30 minutes following the close of the polls.  Sixty-five out of Florida's 67 counties timely completed including highly populated counties such as Miami Dade and Orange.  

More significantly, in Broward County, election officials, led by Supervisor of Elections Dr. Brenda Snipes, were still tabulating without allowing the process to be witnessed as required by Florida's Public Records Act.  The move caused Governor Rick Scott to sue the two counties' election offices for the right to inspect.  Scott prevailed in both hearings leading to court orders requiring that both Supervisors of Elections allow the Governor and his team to inspect the tabulation process.  Neither Supervisor complied with the orders by the 7 pm Friday deadline, a clear affront to the judiciary. 

Snipes herself has a long record of negligence, if not downright fraudulence.  In 2016 Snipes intentionally and improperly destroyed ballots in the Democratic primary election involving Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz according to a May 2018 circuit judge ruling.  Also in 2016, a medical marijuana amendment was left off some ballots distributed in Broward County.  That same year, the Broward County Supervisor of Elections Office began posting elections results prior to the closing of the polling stations.  In 2012, over 1,000 uncounted ballots were discovered a week after the election, and in 2004, 58,000 mail-in ballots were never delivered to voters. 

Snipes continued her gross incompetence this Friday when she mishandled 205 votes irrevocably mixing valid and invalid ballots and then counting them.  According to The Miami Herald there were approximately 20 invalid ballots in this bunch. 

This morning, the Broward Sheriff's Department responded to a call at a Tamarac Lakes Community Center where two locked ballot boxes were found unattended.  This after a report of another box of ballots being found abandoned in a Broward County school.  Additionally, video footage demonstrated private vehicles dropping off ballot boxes onto rental trucks in Broward County without the establishment of a chain of custody.  Similar trucks were also observed delivering boxes into the Supervisor of Elections Office.

Many, including Congressman Matt Gaetz have called for Governor Scott to remove Snipes from her position due to her gross incompetence.  If Governor Scott were to remove Snipes, she would be only the second Supervisor of Elections to be removed from office by a governor, the first one being Miriam Oliphant who, ironically, is Snipes’ predecessor.  

On Saturday, Broward County met the preliminary reporting deadline of 12 pm. The county reported 714,859 votes, up from the original tabulation of 695,799 representing  an increase of 19,060 votes.  While in Palm Beach County, where The Federalist Pages was unable to determine how many ballots had been cast and were outstanding, reports are of 15,000 new ballots having appeared.  

As of Friday afternoon, Nelson trailed Scott by 14,922.

The state has now ordered machine recounts of a handful of races including the Scott/Nelson race.  The counties have until 3pm Thursday to comply.  

All the while, attorneys on both sides are flying complaints at the courts and authorities.  With all these indiscretions and disgruntlement, it is hard to imagine a resolution that would instill Floridians with confidence in their voting process; and that's the greatest tragedy of all.

I want to convert a friend, what’s the best book for a liberal to read to understand a conservative point of view. 

I was thinking Basic Economics by Sowell, but I’m also looking for a book that explains the principles our government was founded on and why they’re so important. My friend knows very little about American history.

Find a way to attack the content you disagree with, not the people espousing that content.*


As moderators we try to find a balance between the freedom of expression and the enforcement of moderate expression. As such, we try enforce as few rules as possible while still maintaining the level of civil discourse that helps this subreddit stand out from others.

Lately, we have been seeing discussion that attacks groups of people which lowers our “civility quotient”, if you will. In the past, these attacks have been few and far between, while being easily confronted and challenged. We feel the increased political drama and the upcoming midterms will only make this problem worse. 

Therefore, we are instituting a *temporary new rule*. It is temporary because the enforcement of it can be subjective when dealing with vaguer infractions. However, we will be able to quickly deal with the infraction and move on. This rule will last a few weeks past the midterms and then be removed.

Any discussion of this can't get past the gate without bringing up Jordan Peterson, somehow espoused as some sort of ""new William F. Buckley"" despite the fact that he lacks Buckley's grace and intelligence; put simply, the phrase ""Postmodernist Neomarxist"" is so syntactically and philosophically bizarre that the only excuse is ignorance.

There, now that I've gotten *that* hate mail out of the way, let's move on.

Peterson's, and indeed a lot of the modern internet's, ire comes straight from one source, Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens' firebrand atheism was *pretty* formative in my college years, but the fact of the matter is that besides being atheist he was pretty far right. He was a neo-con, almost emblematic of the phrase in the years where it was relevant, and he really liked Ayn Rand and *really really hated* Postmodernism. Unfortunately, much like Ayn Rand he didn't spend much time outside philosophies he was comfortable with, and his works ""on Postmodernism"" were written without ever actually being versed in the subject.

That leads us to the question, **what is Postmodernism?** To which a lot of people might respond with an answer. But here's the correct response to that question: *What on earth are you talking about*? Postmodernism, prior to Peterson and Hitchens, most often referred to an artistic style, not a philosophy, or a type of fiction like Pynchon or Vonnegut. It's also an architectural style, a reference to *all cultural works* after the Modernist period, a philosophical term, a political term, or an adjective either used as a pejorative or as a descriptor for something moderately or radically subversive or deconstructive. Generally speaking, what people most often mean, nowadays at least, is a philosophical and political movement largely defined by its detractors.

**What does Postmodernism have to do with Marxism?** Quite a lot, in that the first is a rejection of the latter. All postmodernist philosophy is post-structuralist, and if you take away the structuralist underpinnings of Marxism there really isn't much left. People like Foucault and Derrida were radical anti-Marxists, and thought the whole idea of describing some structuralist arc to human history was dangerously deluded. The enemy of your enemy is not your friend in the battlefields of philosophy, and they disagreed with Marx as much as they disagreed with people like Rand or Murray Rothbard. That's why  ""Postmodernist Neomarxist"" is such an incomprehensible term, like ""Black Panther White Nationalist"".

**Is Postmodernism to blame for identity politics?** Well, no, identity politics existed long before even Marxism, it just got the pejorative name in the 80's and 90's when conservatives didn't much appreciate the identities that liberals were calling on for support. Every political movement, for good or for ill, participated in identity politics. Nazis certainly did, with their blood and soil nonsense, and so did revolutionary Americans, who put certain identities (such as being pro or anti-Crown more or less) above other petty squabbles like, I dunno, whether you thought ""black"" and ""people"" should belong in the same sentence. The ""oppressed vs oppressor"" narrative isn't some invention of feminists or even the 20th Century, it's been around as long as some humans were put in a shitty situation by other humans.

**Does Postmodernism think that reality is subjective?** I mean a straightforward answer is ""no"". People like Derrida and Foucault never argued against objective reality, they argued against some sort of privileged nature of man to observe it. Everything about humans is flawed, so we have to be very very careful about how we correlate observation to fact. Which oddly enough, agrees with how science does things. Certain postmodernists make absurd claims about ""science being a tool of the patriarchy"", but crackpots exist in every philosophy. Ayn Rand thought rape and greed was noble, Rothbard thought child slavery was a property right of the parents, and I don't generally assume most libertarians I meet share those opinions. Postmodernists *are* quite skeptical of the reach of scientific claims, but that's largely historical-- becoming overconfident in our results and having disastrous outcomes is the defining feature of the history of science, and pointing that out isn't being anti-reality. Eugenics, anyone?

**Do Postmodernists think Postmodernism is beyond reproach?** Everyone's convinced their own ideas are right, philosophers aren't any different regardless of political spectrum. I don't think it's beyond reproach, I think there's a lot to criticize. However, when people start that criticism with a patently false statement clearly obtained from a 20-something white dude's Youtube channel designed to generate outrage, I have to roll my eyes. I read both Buckley and the Bible, I read Rand and Rothbard. That doesn't make me right, but it makes me look like an ignorant fool quite a bit less when I criticize modern conservatism and libertarianism. If you're going to criticize Postmodernism it helps to actually read the sources."

Calling it Pro-Life and Pro-Choice is inherently deceptive. Anti-Abortion is much direct and specific
2.	Both political parties are too extreme with this, if you’re Pro-Choice you’re a baby killer, if you’re Pro-Life you’re controlling a woman’s body.
3.	You can be Pro-Choice ~and~ Pro-Life. Personally I think a woman should be able to make decisions about her own body, however I also think abortions should be avoided at all costs through sex ed, birth control, and plan B



Yeah I’m against abortion, but instead of it being banned or so inaccessible it’s essentially banned I think the solution is proper education and birth control. If all that fails, then a woman can decide if she wants to have an abortion, 100% that’s her decision.

If you disagree with me I respect you 100%, let’s talk about it. I’m tired of all this extreme views. The reason I started thinking about this is because of a [podcast by the NYT](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736?mt=2&i=1000422005687). Just because most of my views lean left doesn’t mean I’m a super liberal.

TL;DR I’m frustrated with political divide"

They just want it controlled differently so they can increase their input.

To truly eliminate all gerrymandering we need to draw districts based on population numbers alone. Zero subsets.

* no age

* no gender

* no race

* no financial records

* no political affiliation

Nothing but population alone.  

Can anyone explain how supporting anything but the above isnt supporting gerrymandering?"

Bomb experts are weighing in that the bomb construction was laughable. There is what looks like an ISIS sticker but it's a Larry the Cable Guy meme. Glaring misspellings on the packages and etc. Wires sticking out where there was no need, and parts that just screamed bomb but with no actual purpose.

My gut and prediction(I am a Trump supporter just to put my bias front and center) is that these are hoaxes designed to mimic what they think a conservative would act like. Much like some of the church burnings that were said to be by Trump racists turning out to be people associated with the church. 

I like to follow the evidence in these things and make predictions along the way to see how well I am doing. My gut is saying left winger mimicking a conservative and we're gonna know real fast who the person is. 

Let's watch and find out...at the end of the day I want whoever it is to spend many long years in a prison cell, joke or no joke.

Edit: Just noticed the CNN bomb pic was apparently taken on a break room table. Sooooooooo why are they opening a removing said device and staying in the room and snapping pics if they think it's a real bomb? And we're getting pics from other sources.

This whole discussion of “who’s to blame” following the recent bomb scare has been, frankly, ridiculous. I thought I’d post some moderately-expressed opinions for a hopefully less-idiotic discussion. 

1. Political violence is perpetrated by individuals and groups who identify across the political spectrum, but that does not mean these actions are evenly distributed on “both sides”

2. It’s tricky to show direct causation between a public figure’s words and someone else’s violent actions, and any attempt to do so should be done very carefully and met with skepticism 

3. To the extent that we _can_ place blame on public figures, the things that matter most are: the level of influence the person has (their official or social “rank”), the actual content of their words, and how frequently they use that kind of language 

4. Using the rubric above, nobody can in good faith argue that Donald Trump is not the most egregious user of language that could _potentially_ incite violence

5. Yelling at someone at a restaurant is different than shooting someone, which is different than rioting and destroying property, which is different than mailing bombs...so let’s not act like they’re all the same thing in the same category"

I personally try to read a wide range of news media to help avoid a bias, but I find there to be a much greater amount of holding democratic lawmakers and candidates to their voting records and views.

So how do we make changes in our mental health system that are large enough to make an actual difference.

I have worked in mental health for well over a decade. Mostly with those charged with felony level crimes and men who pleaded out as Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity. 

I personally dont have a good answer.  I do have some questions and concerns though and get frustrated when politicians flippantly say ""we need to improve mental health""

* Reagan didnt just ""cut funding"". He made it illegal to round up people and hold them against their will while being forced medication.  Do people want to go back to this or something similar?  I recognize mental illness in people all the time. Should i be allowed to lock them up?

* if we make mental health ""free"", who is going to treat all these people?  You have good insurance and money.  Good luck making an appointment with a psychiatrist in the next 60 days.  We cannot properly treat all the paying customers.  Who is going to treat all the non paying ones the gov is paying for?

* like rehab...forced treatment is almost never effective over the long term.  Treatment only works if the person wants to change who they are, and even then its hit or miss.

* for the love of god imagine your typical gov worker when you suggest putting mental health workers in the schools.  How do you combat them becoming just another rubber stamp in the school system?"

Having done that, I find that there are very little Republican campaigns that align with that code. It didn't used to be that way. The religious right movement always started to sway that for me, as my moral code is not based in a ""zealous God"" or righteous indignation. For me, it has always been about personal autonomy (true liberty) and respect for other people. I do not believe in ""evil supernatural forces"", so for me the difference between right and wrong is about a misunderstanding or a lack of education on certain matters. 

&#x200B;

In my state, there are no Republican candidates that are running on a platform that aligns with my moral code. And it was a moral code that aligns very well with the founding father, the likes of Thomas Jefferson or back to Laissez Faire policies. It's somewhat ironic that someone from this sort of minimal government intervention mindset would consider the ever growing socialist policies of the Democratic party, but that's just what I've been doing. A few important topics for me are accepting the evidence of Climate Change, and how we can use technology to create another industrial revolution, one that is healthier for the planet, and also develop a plan to sustain ever growing populations with the increase of automation. This includes the boogeyman ""globalization"", which I firmly believe is not an ""evil conspiracy"" nor a plan at all, rather the natural progression of increased population but faster transportation and immediate flow of information across borders. Instead of trying to use the government to reject economic globalization, I would want a government to use more Laissez Faire tactics and act as an aide to it's people, not as a force to control the free market. There are other things like the abandonment of social issues such as transgender or abortion, and simply give people the right to choose how they want to live. It seems as though now more than ever, the Republican Party is becoming the party of government intervention, especially socially. And from my point of view, government intervention on social issues and global trade are a million times more frightening than higher income taxes and a bigger welfare system. I'm not sure how this has gotten so twisted.

&#x200B;

TL;DR, I'm a philosophical libertarian, self identifying moderate who once prided himself on voting for different parties. But now I'm very guilty that I haven't considered any Republican candidates in the last two election cycles. "

Here's a quick run down of the different systems:

First Past the Post: Candidate with most votes wins.

Top 2 primaries: If no candidate gets more than half of all votes, a second election is held where only the two most successful candidates in the first round run.

Alternative Vote: Each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference. If your first candidate is the biggest loser, your vote transfers to your second favorite, if they lose your vote goes to the third, and so on.

Single Transferable Vote: Same as the Alternative Vote, but multiple candidates get elected.

Open-list proportional representation: The number of votes a party gets is proportionate to the seats they receive, voters decide which candidates are prioritized in getting their seats.

Closed-list proportional representation: The number of votes a party gets is proportionate to the seats they receive, which candidates are prioritized to get seats is decided by the party they're a member of.

Parallel voting: Part of the seats are chosen by one system (say, first past the post), the other part chosen by another (say, closed list PR)

Mixed member proportional: Voters vote for a local candidate, and for a party. First local candidates who won their districts get seats, then parties are given extra seats so the number of seats a party gets is proportionate to the votes they get.

Electoral college: Any system where voters vote for members of a group of people whose sole purpose is to choose a winner.
